i followed john’s example, and went out into the hall, where misshoward was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous massof veils that enveloped her head. as her eyes fell on me, a sudden pangof guilt shot through me. this was the woman who had warned me soearnestly, and to whose warning i had, alas, paid no heed! how soon,and how contemptuously, i had dismissed it from my mind. now that shehad been proved justified in so tragic a manner, i felt ashamed. shehad known alfred inglethorp only too well. i wondered whether, if shehad remained at styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or wouldthe man have feared her watchful eyes?

I turned on the oven to make my soup and all the sudden i noticed a glow behind my pot.

James Green aka "Sudden" is a fictional character created by an English author Oliver Strange in the early 1930s as the hero of a series, originally published by George Newnes Books Ltd, set in the American Wild West era. Oliver Strange died in 1952, and the series was revived by Frederick H. Christian in the 1960s. Christian classified the books as "Piccadilly westerns", that is books written by English authors, simply drawing on the conventions the genre, with no first hand experience of America. The Sudden books are among the earliest and best-loved of the type. Sudden is portrayed as an intrepid and accurate gunfighter in search of two men who cheated his foster father. James Green earns the nickname "Sudden" because of his lightning speed with a gun. Sudden is portrayed as a stereotypical gunfighter: an intelligent and resourceful drifting cowboy who is respectful of the law, unwilling to use a gun unless absolutely necessary, humanitarian, brave, strong, and fair. The first book was published in 1930 and was followed by 10 more until the 1940s and featured vivid descriptions of the western American landscape, rare in an author at that time. The series became popular for its exciting narrations combining elements of mystery, suspense, and action, with engaging characters, in a Wild West setting of dusty towns, ranches, and saloons.

it was not, perhaps, her fault that she did not take very kindly tojuliet. the girl resented the place once occupied by her dead motherbeing filled by any newcomer; and was not, it is to be feared, atsufficient pains to hide her feelings on the point. and the second ladybyrne was hardly to be blamed if she remembered that in a few years shewould have three daughters of her own to take out, and felt that a fourthwas almost too much of a good thing.

Once you walk up the two escalators that bring you to the first and second floor, you can't go back.

The second (symbol: s, also abbreviated: sec) is the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI) (French: Système International d’unités), commonly understood and historically defined as 1⁄86400 of a day – this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each. Analog clocks and watches often have sixty tick marks on their faces, representing seconds (and minutes), and a "second hand" to mark the passage of time in seconds.  Digital clocks and watches often have a two-digit seconds counter. The second is also part of several other units of measurement like meters per second for speed, meters per second per second for acceleration, and cycles per second for frequency.

this bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. theheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laidtogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrilythreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediatesilence.

00 within 48 hours or i would have to go to court for infringement upon article 161 (rape and child molestation or something).

A court is any person or institution, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all people have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.

perfectly consistent with himself, as i believe all such monsters to be,this slinkton recovered himself, and showed a defiance that wassufficiently cold and quiet.  he was white, he was haggard, he waschanged; but only as a sharper who had played for a great stake and hadbeen outwitted and had lost the game.

It had about 300$ worth of art goods in it and i lost it because i left it in a locker without a lock on the 3rd floor of an art building.

“we must try and break the door in, i suppose. it’ll be a tough job,though. here, let one of the maids go down and wake baily and tell himto go for dr. wilkins at once. now then, we’ll have a try at the door.half a moment, though, isn’t there a door into miss cynthia’s rooms?”

I try to convince them its her, even show her photo.

"she can go on monday, see the lawyers on tuesday, and come back onwednesday," said lady byrne. "the helplessness of young girls is the onething i disapprove of in your european system of education. it is muchbetter that they should learn to manage their own affairs; and juliet isnot such a ninny as you seem to think."

It's good work, but it's definitely not as fancy or corporate as the types of lawyers you see wearing suits and portrayed in the movies.

A lawyer or attorney is a person who practices law, as an advocate, attorney at law, barrister, barrister-at-law, bar-at-law, canonist, canon lawyer, civil law notary, counsel, counselor, solicitor, legal executive, or public servant preparing, interpreting and applying the law, but not as a paralegal or charter executive secretary. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across different legal jurisdictions.

 “the windows are all dark,” remarked the inspector. “the house seems deserted.”

Now, i've torn the house apart.

A house is a single-unit residential building, which may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space. Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers. Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room. A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room. Some large houses in North America have a recreation room. In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans.

"locked in!" he muttered with a queer glance at his companions. "whatdoes that mean?"

I was eating a sandwich of leftover christmas ham and listening to the queers.

Queer is an umbrella term for people who are not heterosexual or are not cisgender. Originally meaning "strange" or "peculiar", queer came to be used pejoratively against those with same-sex desires or relationships in the late 19th century. Beginning in the late 1980s, queer activists, such as the members of Queer Nation, began to reclaim the word as a deliberately provocative and politically radical alternative to the more assimilationist branches of the LGBT community.In the 21st century, queer became increasingly used to describe a broad spectrum of non-normative sexual and gender identities and politics. Academic disciplines such as queer theory and queer studies share a general opposition to binarism, normativity, and a perceived lack of intersectionality, some of them only tangentially connected to the LGBT movement. Queer arts, queer cultural groups, and queer political groups are examples of modern expressions of queer identities.

"mr. collingwood, and mr. robson, and miss mallathorpe--and anybody,"answered pratt, slowly and firmly, "had better mind what they aresaying, mr. eldrick. there's such a thing as slander, as you're wellaware. i'm not the man to be slandered, or libelled, or to have mycharacter defamed--without fighting for my rights. there has been noundue influence! i went to see mrs. mallathorpe yesterday at her ownrequest. the arrangement between me and her is made with her approvaland free will. if her daughter found her a bit upset, it's because she'dsuch a shock at the time of her son's death. i did nothing to frightenher, not i! the fact is, miss mallathorpe doesn't know that her motherand i have had a bit of business together of late. and all that mrs.mallathorpe has entrusted to me is the power to look after her affairsfor her. and why not? you know that i'm a good man of business, a reallygood hand at commercial accountancy, and well acquainted with the tradeof this town. you know too, mr. eldrick, that i'm scrupulouslyhonest--i've had many and many a thousand pounds of yours and yourpartner's through my hands! who's got anything to say against me? i'monly trying to earn an honest living."

Wrong, it was wednesday, and among how everything else in this country is going to shit i didn't have the state of mind to double check.

The mind is the set of faculties responsible for mental phenomena. Often the term is also identified with the phenomena themselves. These faculties include thought, imagination, memory, will and sensation. They are responsible for various mental phenomena, like perception, pain experience, belief, desire, intention and emotion. Various overlapping classifications of mental phenomena have been proposed. Important distinctions group them together according to whether they are sensory, propositional, intentional, conscious or occurrent. Minds were traditionally understood as substances but it is more common in the contemporary perspective to conceive them as properties or capacities possessed by humans and higher animals. Various competing definitions of the exact nature of the mind or mentality have been proposed. Epistemic definitions focus on the privileged epistemic access the subject has to these states. Consciousness-based approaches give primacy to the conscious mind and allow unconscious mental phenomena as part of the mind only to the extent that they stand in the right relation to the conscious mind. According to intentionality-based approaches, the power to refer to objects and to represent the world is the mark of the mental. For behaviorism, whether an entity has a mind only depends on how it behaves in response to external stimuli while functionalism defines mental states in terms of the causal roles they play. Central questions for the study of mind, like whether other entities besides humans have minds or how the relation between body and mind is to be conceived, are strongly influenced by the choice of one's definition.

"i am going out," said his master, taking up his straw hat. "if anyonecalls, say i could not wait any longer. ah, there's the front-door bell.just see who it is."

Saʽid (Arabic: سعيد‎ Saʽīd), also spelled Saʽeid, Said, Saïd, Sid, Saeed or Sayid, is a male Arabic given name which means "blessed (in Quranic Classical Arabic), good luck, joy" or "happy, patient". The name stems from the Arabic verb sa‘ada (سَعَدَ - 'to be happy, fortunate or lucky').

 “what is this, holmes?” i cried. “this is beyond anything which i could have imagined.”

to each of these three young people this was the most surprising momentwhich life had yet afforded. it was an astonishing thing to find a fellowmortal there at all, but to find that mortal was the scarhaven estateagent was literally short of marvellous. what was also astounding was tosee chatfield's only too evident distress. swathed in a heavy,old-fashioned ulster, with a plaid shawl round his shoulders and adeerstalker hat tied over head and ears with a bandanna handkerchief hesat on the beach nursing his knees, slightly rocking his fleshy figure toand fro and moaning softly with the regularity of a minute bell. his eyeswere fixed on the dark expanse of waters at his feet; his lips, when hewas not moaning, worked incessantly; as he rocked his body he beat histoes on the shingle. clearly, chatfield was in a bad way, mentally. thathe was not so badly off materially was made evident by the presence of ahalf-open kit bag which obviously contained food and a bottle of spirits.

I started to softly say things to myself "god save me" "please stop pooping" "its burning" "how long have i been pooping?" finally the war had ended.

 and this was the singular case of the grecian interpreter, the explanation of which is still involved in some mystery. we were able to find out, by communicating with the gentleman who had answered the advertisement, that the unfortunate young lady came of a wealthy grecian family, and that she had been on a visit to some friends in england. while there she had met a young man named harold latimer, who had acquired an ascendancy over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him. her friends, shocked at the event, had contented themselves with informing her brother at athens, and had then washed their hands of the matter. the brother, on his arrival in england, had imprudently placed himself in the power of latimer and of his associate, whose name was wilson kemp—a man of the foulest antecedents. these two, finding that through his ignorance of the language he was helpless in their hands, had kept him a prisoner, and had endeavoured by cruelty and starvation to make him sign away his own and his sister’s property. they had kept him in the house without the girl’s knowledge, and the plaster over the face had been for the purpose of making recognition difficult in case she should ever catch a glimpse of him. her feminine perception, however, had instantly seen through the disguise when, on the occasion of the interpreter’s visit, she had seen him for the first time. the poor girl, however, was herself a prisoner, for there was no one about the house except the man who acted as coachman, and his wife, both of whom were tools of the conspirators. finding that their secret was out, and that their prisoner was not to be coerced, the two villains with the girl had fled away at a few hours’ notice from the furnished house which they had hired, having first, as they thought, taken vengeance both upon the man who had defied and the one who had betrayed them.

One thing i've learned about myself by now is that i'll always fuck up something important by screwing up the simplest part.

"it wasn't your fault," she said. "it's nobody's fault. don't blame mr.vickers--he couldn't foresee this. yes, i'm all right--and i slept like atop. what's the use of worrying? do you know," she went on, lowering hervoice and drawing nearer to him, "i believe something's going to come ofall this--something that'll clear matters up once and for all."

I was blamed and scolded by the teachers who accused me of doing it on purpose.

Blame is the act of censuring, holding responsible, making negative statements about an individual or group that their actions or inaction are socially or morally irresponsible, the opposite of praise.  When someone is morally responsible for doing something wrong, their action is blameworthy. By contrast, when someone is morally responsible for doing something right, we may say that his or her action is praiseworthy. There are other senses of praise and blame that are not ethically relevant. One may praise someone's good dress sense, and blame their own sense of style for their own dress sense.

the tragic circumstances of the murder had aroused great excitement allover the countryside, and a large gathering assembled at the littleisland at the head of the loch, where the mcconachans had left theirbones since the early days of the youth of the race.

Not sure if they knew it was an adult diaper or just thought it was a large pair of tighty-whities.

Large means of great size.

 “on the contrary,” said holmes, “out of my last fifty-three cases my name has only appeared in four, and the police have had all the credit in forty-nine. i don’t blame you for not knowing this, for you are young and inexperienced, but if you wish to get on in your new duties you will work with me and not against me.”

The fuck are we going to do the rest of the day?! we have monday and tuesday then she leaves :,(

wish me luck guys.

A wish is a hope or desire for something. In fiction, wishes can be used as plot devices. In folklore, opportunities for "making a wish" or for wishes to "come true" or "be granted" are themes that are sometimes used.

"stabbed!" he muttered. "stabbed to death! and dragged in here--look atthat--and that!"

I cried a little when i dragged them closer so i could see them.

 “that, also, is still obscure. but we have learned a good deal, you perceive. we know that a man stood in the road looking at the quarrel between the barclays—the blinds were up and the room lighted. we know, also, that he ran across the lawn, entered the room, accompanied by a strange animal, and that he either struck the colonel or, as is equally possible, that the colonel fell down from sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his head on the corner of the fender. finally, we have the curious fact that the intruder carried away the key with him when he left.”

More frighteningly, will i get lured into his position? you see, i’m in an awkward position as it is already.

gimblet glanced to right and left, up the glen and down it. there was noone to be seen. the sun had fallen by this time beneath the rim of thehills; a greyness of twilight was spread over the whole scene, and underthe trees the dusk of night was already silently ousting the day. heturned once more to lady ruth.

Even worse the water is killing the trees in the front.

In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development.

the three occupants of the room appeared to pay no attention. thechess-players went on playing; the other man reached for a canister,and mechanically emptied tea out of it into his pot.

The blacks aren't people!" this cry could be heard from all the way down the hall in the other classrooms.

In a building, a room is any space enclosed within a number of walls to which entry is possible only by a door or other dividing structure that connects it either to a passageway, to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it.

the gates were near at hand; in silence they breasted the steep inclineof the drive, which wound and zigzagged up between high banks coveredwith rhododendron and bracken, and grown over with trees. after a quarterof a mile these gave place to an abrupt, grass covered slope, whose tophad been smoothed and levelled by the hand of man, and from which on thefar side rose the castle of inverashiel, its stout and ancient frameworkdisguised and masked by the modern addition to the building which facedthe approach; a mass of gabled and turreted stonework in the worst styleof nineteenth century architecture which in scotland often took on ashape and semblance even more fantastically repulsive than it assumed inthe south. the great tower that formed the principal remaining portion ofthe old building could just be discerned over the top of the flaringfaçade, but the nature of the site was such that most of the ancientfortress was invisible from that part of the grounds. juliet stopped atthe turn of the road.

since eldrick's visit of the previous day, pratt had been prepared forall eventuality. he had made ready for flight. and he was not goingempty-handed. he had a considerable amount of mrs. mallathorpe's moneyin his possession; by obtaining her signature to one or two documents hecould easily obtain much more in london, at an hour's notice. thosedocuments were all ready, and in the sealed packet which he had justtaken from the safe; in it, too, were some other documents--johnmallathorpe's will; the letter which mrs. mallathorpe had written to himon the evening previous to her son's fatal accident; and the power ofattorney which pratt had obtained from her at his first interview afterthat occurrence. all was ready--and now there was nothing to do but toget to normandale grange, see mrs. mallathorpe, and--vanish. he hadplanned it all out, carefully, when he perceived the first dangersignals, and knew that his other plans and schemes were doomed tofailure. half an hour at normandale grange--a journey to london--acouple of hours in the city--and then the next train to the continent,on his way to regions much further off. here, things had turned outbadly, unexpectedly badly--but he would carry away considerable, easilytransported wealth, to a new career in a new country.

I had never seen one in the flesh, a newer gen at least.

New is an adjective referring to something recently made, discovered, or created.

"have you seen mrs. or miss greyle since the inquest?" asked copplestone,who was anxious to keep off subjects on which he might be supposed topossess information. "have you been over there?"

So a bit ago i asked my friend if i could borrow a can of that spray air stuff so i could clean all the dust out of  my graphics card.

A question is an utterance which typically functions as a request for information, which is expected to be provided in the form of an answer. Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered.

 i was weary of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced. for three hours we strolled about together, watching the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through fleet street and the strand. holmes had shaken off his temporary ill-humour, and his characteristic talk, with its keen observance of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and enthralled. it was ten o’clock before we reached baker street again. a brougham was waiting at our door.

She seemed so keen and the last snap she sent to me said 'i'll show you mine if you show me yours' with her standing in her underwear.

"you suspect chang li?" asked yada.

Now i'm looking for a new job, and i suspect those ugly shoes are hurting me.

In law enforcement jargon, a suspect is a known person accused or suspected of committing a crime. Police and reporters in the United States often use the word suspect as a jargon when referring to the perpetrator of the offense (perp in dated US slang). However, in official definition, the perpetrator is the robber, assailant, counterfeiter, etc.—the person who committed the crime. The distinction between suspect and perpetrator recognizes that the suspect is not known to have committed the offense, while the perpetrator—who may not yet have been suspected of the crime, and is thus not necessarily a suspect—is the one who did. The suspect may be a different person from the perpetrator, or there may have been no actual crime, which would mean there is no perpetrator.A common error in police reports is a witness description of the suspect (as a witness generally describes a perpetrator, while a mug shot is of  a suspect). Frequently it is stated that police are looking for the suspect, when there is no suspect; the police could be looking for a suspect, but they are surely looking for the perpetrator, and very often it is impossible to tell from such a police report whether there is a suspect or not.

I decide that "i am a man, i don't stop for slight discomfort, i shall keep running" (fuck up 2).

Shall and will are two of the English modal verbs. They have various uses, including the expression of propositions about the future, in what is usually referred to as the future tense of English.

when i rejoined them, mr. slinkton was the first to speak.  indeed, hesaid to me in a raised voice before i came up with him:

Moments later i hear my mom freaking out upstairs and two booming male voices.

The human voice consists of sound made by a human being using the vocal tract, including talking, singing, laughing, crying, screaming, shouting, or yelling. The human voice frequency is specifically a part of human sound production in which the vocal folds (vocal cords) are the primary sound source. (Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of unvoiced consonants, clicks, whistling and whispering.)

 “‘for two days rachel howells had been so ill, sometimes delirious, sometimes hysterical, that a nurse had been employed to sit up with her at night. on the third night after brunton’s disappearance, the nurse, finding her patient sleeping nicely, had dropped into a nap in the armchair, when she woke in the early morning to find the bed empty, the window open, and no signs of the invalid. i was instantly aroused, and, with the two footmen, started off at once in search of the missing girl. it was not difficult to tell the direction which she had taken, for, starting from under her window, we could follow her footmarks easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere, where they vanished close to the gravel path which leads out of the grounds. the lake there is eight feet deep, and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it.

Goddamn rachel roxxx, you sure do the trick.

Rachel (Hebrew: רָחֵל‎, romanized: Rāḥēl, lit. 'ewe') was a Biblical figure, the favorite of Jacob's two wives, and the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, two of the twelve progenitors of the tribes of Israel. Rachel's father was Laban. Her older sister was Leah, Jacob's first wife. Her aunt Rebecca was Jacob's mother.

he knew that it was thirty or forty feet above the level of theground--but there was much thick ivy growing on the walls of normandalegrange, and it might be possible to climb down by its aid. with a greateffort he forced open one of the dirt-encrusted sashes and lookedout--and in the same instant he drew in his head with a harsh groan. thewindow commanded a full view of the hall door--and he had seen prydale,and two other detectives, and the stranger from london whom he believedto be a detective, hurrying from their motorcar into the house.

I instantly knew something was wrong, it was way worse than the feeling i had when pinching my finger between 2 weights in the past.

In physics and the philosophy of science, instant refers to an infinitesimal interval in time, whose passage is instantaneous.  In ordinary speech, an instant has been defined as "a point or very short space of time," a notion deriving from its etymological source, the Latin verb instare, from in- + stare ('to stand'), meaning 'to stand upon or near.'The continuous nature of time and its infinite divisibility was addressed by Aristotle in his Physics, where he wrote on Zeno's paradoxes. The philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell was still seeking to define the exact nature of an instant thousands of years later.In physics, a theoretical lower-bound unit of time called the Planck time has been proposed, that being the time required for light to travel a distance of 1 Planck length. The Planck time is theorized to be the smallest time measurement that will ever be possible, roughly 10−43 seconds. Within the framework of the laws of physics as they are understood their lifetime, for times less than two Planck time apart, one can neither measure nor detect any change. It is therefore physically impossible, with current technology, to determine if any action exists that causes a reaction in "an instant", rather than reoccurring after an interval of time too short to observe or measure.

 “my first feeling, as i have just said, was one of pity and horror. my second, i fear, was rather one of professional satisfaction. i made notes of my patient’s pulse and temperature, tested the rigidity of his muscles, and examined his reflexes. there was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions, which harmonised with my former experiences. i had obtained good results in such cases by the inhalation of nitrite of amyl, and the present seemed an admirable opportunity of testing its virtues. the bottle was downstairs in my laboratory, so leaving my patient seated in his chair, i ran down to get it. there was some little delay in finding it—five minutes, let us say—and then i returned. imagine my amazement to find the room empty and the patient gone.

The entire room is full of display cases and large cabinets with dozens of drawers.

his mind, always active, was busier than usual as he watched theripples roll away in endless succession from the sides of the inverashiel --which looked so strangely less white on closerinspection--or followed the smooth soaring movements of the gulls thatswooped and circled around her, as she puffed and panted on her wayacross the black, taciturn waters.

As quickly as i can, i decide on a name and begin to spell it, making my movements rigid as i could.

but it needed more than a mere drop of brandy, more than cousinly wordsof adjuration, to bring the wounded man back to a state of speech. andwhen at last he managed to make a feeble response, it was only to muttersome incoherent and disjointed sentences about and being struck down frombehind--after which he again relapsed into semi-unconsciousness.

Me and 3 of my buddies wanted to go to seattle to meet my other friend and do some shopping since shit is cheaper in the states than it is in canada.

"and as to that," continued dr. tretheway, "i learnt from mr. greyle thathe had been seriously indisposed for some months before setting out forengland. the voyage had been rather a rough one; he had suffered muchfrom sea-sickness, and, in his state of health, that was unfortunate forhim. i made a careful examination of him, and i came to the conclusionthat he was suffering from a form of myocarditis which was rapidlyassuming a very serious complexion. i earnestly advised him to take asmuch rest as possible, to avoid all unnecessary fatigue and allexcitement, and i strongly deprecated his travelling in one journey tothe north, whither i learnt he was bound. on my advice, he and mr.chatfield decided to break that journey at bristol, at birmingham, and atleeds. by so doing, you see, they would only have a short journey eachday, and mr. greyle would be able to rest for a long time at a stretch.but--i formed my own conclusions."

Seriously, i felt like crying at that point but once i stopped seeing red.

"acting together--acting together, you know!" replied eldrick. "it'sthose people who really want him--halstead & byner, inquiry agents,working for a firm of city solicitors. i'm only local agent--as itwere."

I'm a web consultant and manage websites for people.

A people is any plurality of persons considered as a whole.

"well, now, i just don't!" he replied. "the fact is--as you wouldunderstand if you knew the circumstances--this was a queer sort of asecret deal, in which the assistance of various men of differentnationality was wanted, and none of us knew any of the rest. however, idid come across the englishman who was in it--afterwards. recognizedhim, as a matter of fact, by his being in possession of those studs."

I thought he was gonna mug me or at least offer me assistance, he did neither.

juliet had no money. lady byrne had left her fortune to her husband, andrash speculations on his part had reduced it to a meagre amount, which hefelt no inclination to part with. two or three years went by, and shereceived no proposals. sir arthur's hopes of seeing her provided for grewfaint, and he could imagine no way out of his difficulties. he himselfspent his leave in england, but he never took the girl with him on thoseholidays. he had no wish to be called on to explain her presence to suchof his friends as might not remember his wife's whim; and, though shepassed as his daughter abroad, she could not do that at home.

i was using my left hand with no gloves my i cut under my right thumb drunkenly on my window the night before.

"mr. bassett oliver is dead," interrupted greyle, almost harshly. "nodoctors can do any good. now, look here," he continued, pulling them to asudden halt, "i want all of you to take particular notice of this oldtower--the keep. i believe you have not been in here before, mr.copplestone--just pay particular attention to this place. here you see isthe keep, standing in the middle of what i suppose was the courtyard ofthe old castle. it's a square tower, with a stair-turret at one angle.the stair in that turret is in a very good state of preservation--infact, it is quite easy to climb to the top, and from the top there's afine view of land and sea: the keep itself is nearly a hundred feet inheight. now the inside of the keep is completely gutted, as you'llpresently see--there isn't a floor left of the five or six which wereonce there. and i'm sorry to say there's very little protection whenone's at the top--merely a narrow ledge with a very low parapet, which inplaces is badly broken. consequently, any one who climbs to the top mustbe very careful, or there's the danger of slipping off that ledge andfalling to the bottom. now in my opinion that's precisely what happenedon sunday afternoon. oliver evidently got in here, climbed the stairs inthe turret to enjoy the view and fell from the parapet. and why his bodyhasn't been found before i'll now show you."

Well this week it was my turn to bake a cake for the class to enjoy.

“yes. i should fancy he had found her very useful,” remarked poirot.“so long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, anyother vagaries of the doctor’s passed unobserved.”

So i get to the desk and the girl says its not valid for travel because the names arent the same.

A name is a term used for identification by an external observer. They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. The entity identified by a name is called its referent. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning as well) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called "common names" or (obsolete) "general names". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name.

 “hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. straker was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to have quite realized its true significance. it left him, however, vaguely uneasy, and mrs. straker, waking at one in the morning, found that he was dressing. in reply to her inquiries, he said that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see that all was well. she begged him to remain at home, as she could hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.

He asks me what my major is and i reply english and psychology.

"the old man may have found it in the 'bus," suggested a third policeofficer who had come up. "looks as if he had."

It was an early start, out of bed at 5 for the transport, which turned out to be a rickety old jeep with benches in the back.

“pardon me,  mon ami , you were not precisely  sympathique .” he turnedto me earnestly. “tell me—you see now that he must not be arrested?”

More precisely, let's put all the pieces of paper down on the dining room table and staple them that way.

they were at the pawnshop by that time, and all six trooped in at theside-entrance. old daniel multenius, unconscious of all the fuss andbother which his death had caused, was to be quietly interred thatafternoon, and zillah and melky were already in their mourninggarments. but zillah had lost none of her business habits andinstincts, and while the faithful mrs. goldmark attended to the funeralguests in the upstairs regions, she herself was waiting in theback-parlour for these other visitors. on the table before her,evidently placed there for inspection, lay three objects to which sheat once drew attention--one, an old-fashioned, double-breasted fancywaistcoat, evidently of considerable age, and much worn, the others,two letters written on foreign notepaper.

I had packed 6 beers for myself and a liter of jack daniels straight.

Daniel is a masculine given name and a surname of Hebrew origin.  It means "God is my judge" (cf. Gabriel—"God is my strength"), and derives from two early biblical figures, primary among them Daniel from the Book of Daniel. It is a common given name for males, and is also used as a surname. It is also the basis for various derived given names and surnames.

 “my dear watson, professor moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet. i went out about midday to transact some business in oxford street. as i passed the corner which leads from bentinck street on to the welbeck street crossing a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed round and was on me like a flash. i sprang for the foot-path and saved myself by the fraction of a second. the van dashed round by marylebone lane and was gone in an instant. i kept to the pavement after that, watson, but as i walked down vere street a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses, and was shattered to fragments at my feet. i called the police and had the place examined. there were slates and bricks piled up on the roof preparatory to some repairs, and they would have me believe that the wind had toppled over one of these. of course i knew better, but i could prove nothing. i took a cab after that and reached my brother’s rooms in pall mall, where i spent the day. now i have come round to you, and on my way i was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon. i knocked him down, and the police have him in custody; but i can tell you with the most absolute confidence that no possible connection will ever be traced between the gentleman upon whose front teeth i have barked my knuckles and the retiring mathematical coach, who is, i daresay, working out problems upon a blackboard ten miles away. you will not wonder, watson, that my first act on entering your rooms was to close your shutters, and that i have been compelled to ask your permission to leave the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front door.”

I woke up like 5 minutes ago, it's not 12:48 and the deadline closed at 12, my alarm didn't go off for whatever reason.

 it was a blazing hot day in august. baker street was like an oven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across the road was painful to the eye. it was hard to believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of winter. our blinds were half-drawn, and holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the morning post. for myself, my term of service in india had trained me to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship. but the morning paper was uninteresting. parliament had risen. everybody was out of town, and i yearned for the glades of the new forest or the shingle of southsea. a depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him. he loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people, with his filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. appreciation of nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his brother of the country.

The goal is to solve complex issues presented to you in a fashion that fits their pre-requisites.

In the field of medicine, a presentation is the appearance of sign or symptom of illness or disease by a patient before a medical professional.  It is usually used as a verb ('present'), with emphasis on the second syllable, and is often accompanied by the preposition "with".  Consider the following examples:

 i glanced down at the new patent leathers which i was wearing. “how on earth—” i began, but holmes answered my question before it was asked.

Calling on my inner sherlock holmes i concluded they must've gone out for a drink (my friend had slept at the airport and wasn't as tired.

the man carefully drew the cork of a bottle, poured out its contents withthe discrimination of a bartender, handed the glass to his visitor with abow, helped himself to a measure of rum, and bowed again as he drank.

So off to the kitchen i went, i carefully climbed the obstacle course that is a man's city apartment.

Dancing with the Devil... the Art of Starting Over is the seventh studio album by American singer Demi Lovato. It was released on April 2, 2021 by Island Records, and was recorded alongside a docu-series by YouTube Originals, titled Demi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil, which documents their recovery and self-discovery. Produced by a variety of collaborators, such as Mitch Allan, Lauren Aquilina, Tommy Brown, Oak Felder, Jussifer, Matthew Koma and Pop & Oak, the album is a pop record with lyrics on Lovato's journey through their hurdles and self-empowerment. It follows a reformative period in the singer's life and career, after being hospitalized for a drug overdose in 2018.

"i think you'll be sorry--on reflection--that you said that, missmallathorpe," he answered. "you're a little--shall we say--upset? alittle--shall we say--angry? if you were calmer, you wouldn't say suchthings--you wouldn't use such a term as--blackmailing. it's--dear me, idare say you don't know it!--it's actionable. if i were that sort ofman, miss mallathorpe, and you said that of me before witnesses--ah! idon't know what mightn't happen. however--i'm not that sort of man.but--don't say it again, if you please!"

" i laughed to myself for a bit thinking this was a decently funny idea.

In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes. In a slightly different sense, the term thought refers not to the mental processes themselves but to  mental states or systems of ideas brought about by these processes.

the place was evidently a tool-house, used by the gardeners for storingtheir implements. rakes, spades, forks and hoes leant against the walls;a shelf held a quantity of odds and ends: trowels, seedsmen's catalogues,a pot of paint, a bundle of wooden labels, the rose of a watering-can,and a dozen other small objects. on the floor were piled boxes and emptycases; flowerpots stood beside a bag which bore the name of a patentfertilizer; a small hand mowing-machine blocked the entrance; and aplank, too long to lie flat on the ground, had been propped slantwisebetween the floor and the roof. bunches of bass hung from nails above theshelf; and on the wall opposite, a coloured advertisement, representingphloxes of so fierce an intensity of hue that nature was put to theblush, had been tacked by some admirer of art.

At 3 am when you're bored what are you expected to do? fap? did that at 2 am.

Bore or Bores often refer to:

she took them from him soon, with a little inclination of the head whichhe felt was accompanied by a smile of thanks, though through the thickcrape it was impossible to do more than guess at any expression.

She is sleeping butt naked, ass facing the shitty little top bunk (she was in a bunk bed) with the blankets off.

"i have to thank you for letting me out," he said. "the air in there wasgetting terrible." he paused, and filled his lungs ostentatiously, butno one answered him. losing something of his assumed calmness, he wenton, uneasily: "i just thought i'd come along and see if there was anytruth in mr. gimblet's story; and i was quite right to doubt it, sincethere isn't. he's not quite as clever as he thinks, for he was aspositive as you like that my uncle's will was hidden here, but as amatter of fact it's not, as i was taking the trouble to make sure whenthat cursed statue shut me in. there's nothing in it of any sort exceptan empty tin box."

And then i started farting.

Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery metal that characteristically has a faint yellow hue.

it was midday on the following day when he got off the steamer that hadbrought him from crianan, and landed with his luggage on the wooden pierwhich displayed, painted on a rough board, the name of inverashiel.

So i'm currently on holiday in croatia and today we thought we'd go climb the walls of dubrovnik (kings landing in got).

The word day has a number of meanings, depending on the context it is used such as of astronomy, physics, and various calendar systems.   

pratt stood, in a little hollow wherein they had paused, and thought,rapidly and angrily. there was no doubt about it--he was trapped. thisfearful scoundrel at his side, who boasted of his cleverness, wouldstick to him like a leach--he would have to share. all his own smartschemes for exploiting mrs. mallathorpe, for ensuring himself acompetence for life, were knocked on the head. there was no helpingit--he would have to tell--and to share. and so, sullenly, resentfully,he told.

Now for the fuck up, i was taking the trash out like any other day and there was some huge ass bug on the container.

In English, the word like has a very flexible range of uses, ranging from conventional to non-standard. It can be used as a noun, verb, adverb, adjective, preposition, particle, conjunction, hedge, filler, and quotative.

in truth, i could hardly have believed that the broken man who then spoketo me was the man who had so strongly and so differently impressed mewhen his purpose was before him.  i used such entreaties with him, as icould; but he still said, and always said, in a patient, undemonstrativeway,—nothing could avail him,—he was broken-hearted.

But, she hardly looked like what i thought she did.

“really, i can’t tell you. he asked dorcas some question about a bell,and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about asyou see!”

The op responded, delighted with my advice, thanked me and that was the end of that.

Delighted (Persian: ارادتمند؛ نازنین، بهاره، تینا‎, romanized: Eradatmand) is an unreleased 2016 drama film written and directed by Abdolreza Kahani. Starring Mahnaz Afshar, Tannaz Tabatabaei, Aida Mahiani, Mehran Ghafourian and Sahar Dolatshahi, Delighted is the story of three Iranian women "who want to have a good time" and to attain that end, are doing their best to find rich men for themselves.

"don't!" broke in audrey. "that's no good. mr. vickers certainly did whathe felt to be best--and who could foresee this? and i'm not afraid--andas for my mother, if we don't return very soon, why, she knows where weare and there are police in scarhaven, and--"

Managed to lose part of my finger tip, my entire nail and also broke the bone, all because i asked my son to watch some cartoons.

"i wish i could think it the correct one," replied copplestone. "but wecan soon find out if it is--there's a telephone in the hall. yet--i'm sosure that you're wrong, that i'm not even going to ring norcaster up. mr.bassett oliver has--disappeared here!"

Lastly, arrows, papers logically placed throughout the buildings, telephone poles, etc.

A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly. A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user. The term is derived from Greek: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice), together meaning distant voice. A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use almost immediately after the first patent was issued.In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice at a second device. This instrument was further developed by many others, and became rapidly indispensable in business, government, and in households.

I texted her with what was supposed to be "david", which is the name of my late father.

David (; Hebrew: דָּוִד‎, Modern: Davīd, Tiberian: Dāwīḏ) is described in the Hebrew Bible as a king of the United Monarchy of Israel and Judah. In the Books of Samuel, David is a young shepherd who gains fame first as a musician and later by killing the giant Goliath, a champion of the Philistines in southern Canaan. David becomes a favourite of the first king of united Israel, Saul, and forges a close friendship with Jonathan, a son of Saul. Out of suspicion that David is seeking to usurp the throne, Saul attempts to kill David, forcing the latter to go into hiding and operate as a fugitive for several years. After Saul and Jonathan are both killed in battle against the Philistines, a 30-year-old David is anointed king over all of Israel and Judah, following which he conquers the city of Jerusalem, establishes it as Israel's capital, and takes the Ark of the Covenant into the city to be the centre-point of worship in the Israelite religion.

"why," replied byner, "if he's dead--as he may be--this money goes tosomebody else--a relative. the relative would be very glad to hear he isdead! but--definite news will be welcome, in any case. oh, yes, now thati've got down here, i shall do my best to trace him. you have theaddress of the woman he lodged with, you say. i shall go there first, ofcourse. then i must try to find out what he did with himself in hisspare time. but, from all you tell me, it's my impression he'sdead--unless, as you say, he's got into prison again--possibly underanother name. it seems impossible that he should not have seen ouradvertisements."

Pretty much straight away i heard the people on the other side of the street stop walking and heard a woman's voice saying 'excuse me?'.

A woman is an adult female human. Prior to adulthood, a female human is referred to as a girl (a female child or adolescent). The plural women is sometimes used in certain phrases such as "women's rights" to denote female humans regardless of age.

"there's a young woman just gone up to the house that wants to see youvery particular, miss," he said. "i tell'd her that you'd gone tobarford, but she said she'd come a long way, and she'd wait till youcome back. she's going across the park there--crossin' yon path."

But it's more likely that what grown woman wants to ask her daughters 16 year old boyfriend why he was sanitizing his goods in her bathroom.

The idea of want can be examined from many perspectives. In secular societies want might be considered similar to the emotion desire, which can be studied scientifically through the disciplines of psychology or sociology. Want might also be examined in economics as a necessary ingredient in sustaining and perpetuating capitalist societies that are organised around principles like consumerism. Alternatively want can be studied in a non-secular, spiritual, moralistic or religious way, particularly by Buddhism but also Christianity, Islam and Judaism.

pratt was in eldrick & pascoe's office soon after half-past eight nextmorning, and for nearly forty minutes he had the place entirely tohimself. but it took only a few of those minutes for him to do what hehad carefully planned before he went to bed the previous night. shuttinghimself into eldrick's private room, and making sure that he was alonethat time, he immediately opened the drawer in the senior partner'sdesk, wherein eldrick, culpably enough, as parrawhite had sneeringlyremarked, was accustomed to put loose money. eldrick was strangelycareless in that way: he would throw money into that drawer in presenceof his clerks--notes, gold, silver. if it happened to occur to him, hewould take the money out at the end of the afternoon and hand it topratt to lock up in the safe; but as often as not, it did not occur.pratt had more than once ventured on a hint which was almost aremonstrance, and eldrick had paid no attention to him. he was acareless, easy-going man in many respects, eldrick, and liked to dothings in his own way. and after all, as pratt had decided, when hefound that his hints were not listened to, it was eldrick's own affairif he liked to leave the money lying about.

Was hoping to get to bed slightly early.

A bed is a piece of furniture which is used as a place to sleep, rest, and relax.Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned mattress on a bed frame. The mattress rests either on a solid base, often wood slats, or a sprung base. Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base, which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs, to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two people. While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the murphy bed, which folds into a wall, the sofa bed, which folds out of a sofa, and the bunk bed, which provides two mattresses on two tiers as well as a ladder to access the upper tier. Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot. Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the hammock. Other beds are made specifically for animals.

copplestone and gilling, who had never seen this part of the coastbefore, looked out on the scene with lively interest. it was certainly aprospect of romance and of wild, almost savage beauty on which theygazed. immediately in front of them, at a distance of twenty to thirtyyards, stood the old peel tower, a solid square mass of grey stone,intact as to its base and its middle stories, ruinous and crumbling fromthence to what was left of its battlements and the turret tower at oneangle. the fallen stone lay in irregular heaps on the ground at its foot;all around it were clumps of furze and bramble. from the level plateau onwhich it stood the glen fell away in horseshoe formation graduallynarrowing and descending until it terminated in a thick covert of fir andpine that ran down to the land end of the cove of which spurge had toldthem. and beyond that stretched the wide expanse of sea, with here andthere a red-sailed fishing boat tossing restlessly on the white-cappedwaves, and over that and the land was a chill silence, broken only by theoccasional cry of the sea-birds and the bleating of the mountain sheep.

I know he's seen my boobs.

she was already twenty-three when sir arthur married again. the lady wasan american: mrs. clarency butcher, a good-looking widow of aboutthirty-five, with three little girls, of whom the eldest was fifteen. shehad not the enormous wealth which is often one of her countrywomen's mostpleasing attributes, but she was moderately well off and came of a goodcolonial family. having lived for several years in england, she had grownto prefer the king's english to the president's, and had dropped, almostcompletely, the accent of her native country. she was extremely welleducated, and talked three other languages with equal correctness, herfirst husband having been attached to various european legations.altogether, she was a charming and attractive woman, and there were manywho envied sir arthur for the second time in his life.

My sister was home after all, and she was… having a moment with herself.

"just to keep your eyes and your ears open," said sir cresswell. "don'tseem to make inquiries--in fact, don't make any inquiry--do nothing. idon't want you to do any private detective work--not i! just stop herea bit--amuse yourself--write--read--and watch things quietly. and--don'tbe cross--i've an elderly man's privilege, you know--you'll send yourbills to me."

This happened about 10 years ago, when i was in college.

The ear is the organ that enables hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three parts—the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word "ear" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.

 “before examining the room i cross-questioned the servants, but only succeeded in eliciting the facts which i have already stated. one other detail of interest was remembered by jane stewart, the housemaid. you will remember that on hearing the sound of the quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants. on that first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hear hardly anything, and judged by their tones rather than their words that they had fallen out. on my pressing her, however, she remembered that she heard the word ‘david’ uttered twice by the lady. the point is of the utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel. the colonel’s name, you remember, was james.

What the hell do i do? at this point i'm just waiting to see if she responds to the e-mail .

the police officials, as with one consent, glanced at mr. killick, andby their looks seemed to invite his assistance. the old gentlemannodded and turned to the caller.

I spent the next 5-10 minutes cleaning while getting weird looks by my neighbors and cars driving by.

Human physical appearance is the outward phenotype or look of human beings.

when the landlord had gone eldrick motioned byner to pick up his hat."come across the street with me," he said. "i want us to have aconsultation with a friend of mine, a barrister, mr. collingwood. forthis matter is assuming a very queer aspect, and we can't move toowarily, nor consider all the features too thoroughly."

Next, i got what could be considered my first "real" job with a thriving start-up company.

"i am sorry that you gentlemen should have been drawn into all thiswretched business!" she exclaimed, as she pointed the two men to chairs."everything must seem very strange, and indeed have seemed so for sometime. but i have been the victim of as bad a scoundrel as everlived--i'm not going to be so hypocritical as to pretend that i'm sorryhe's dead--i'm not! i only wish he'd met his proper fate--on thescaffold. i don't know what you may have heard, or gathered--my daughterherself, from what she tells me, has only the vaguest notions--but iwanted to tell you, mr. eldrick, and you, mr. collingwood--seeing thatyou're one a solicitor and the other a barrister, that pratt invented amost abominable plot against me, which, of course, hasn't a word oftruth in it, yet was so clever that----"

I met my victim face to face with several words of apology and regret.

 “well, it seems to me that it is just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow william was not before, but after, the entrance of the burglar into the house. you appear to take it for granted that, although the door was forced, the robber never got in.”

My first fuck up came when i overcooked the chicken making it impossible to remove and debone.

Possibility is the condition or fact of being possible. Latin origins of the word hint at ability.

"did he say if he knew for a fact that the diamond was delivered tomultenius?" asked mr. killick.

The last time we made out i didn't think i delivered enough, so when i saw her today i decided to try and make up for it.

Delivered is a 1999 thriller/crime film directed by Guy Ferland. A pizza boy finds a murdered man at his next delivery and becomes the murderer's next intended victim.

by the time she had been admitted to eldrick's private room, nesta hadregained her composure; she had also had time to think, and her presentaction was the result of at any rate a part of her thoughts. she wascalm and collected enough when she took the chair which the solicitordrew forward.

To this day he has never admitted drinking the "moonshine" but we all know it happened.

"then--in answer to any letter or telegram of inquiry--you'll just saythat you knew parrawhite by sight as a clerk at eldrick & pascoe's inthis town, that on november 23rd he told you that he was going toemigrate to america, that next day you booked him his passage, for whichhe paid you whatever it was, and that he thereupon set off forliverpool. see?"

Her text back was
"i'm going to the hockey game tonight"

i told her "i might be there" and didn't hear from her the rest of the day.

"i should just like to know something," continued eldrick again, lookingat collingwood as if for approval. "that is--mrs. mallathorpe's presentdisposition towards affairs in general and pratt in particular. missmallathorpe!--just do something which i will now suggest to you. whenyou reach home, see your mother--she is still, i understand, an invalid,though evidently able to transact business. just approach her gently andkindly, and tell her that you are a little--should we sayuncomfortable?--about certain business arrangements which you hear shehas made with mr. pratt, and ask her, if she won't talk them over withyou, and give you her full confidence. it's now half-past twelve,"continued eldrick, looking at his watch. "you'll be home before lunch.see your mother early in the afternoon, and then telephone, briefly, theresult to me, here, at four o'clock. then--mr. collingwood and i willhave a consultation."

She continued to rant.

...Continued is the second album released by Tony Joe White. It was released on Monument Records and contained the single Roosevelt and Ira Lee It was recorded at Monument Studios, Nashville and Lyn-Lou Studios, Memphis in 1969. It was produced by Billy Swan and engineered by Tommy Strong and Mort Thomasson.

with the day she awoke, stiff and hungry. how long would it be before shewas found? she felt braver under this new stimulus of hunger and moreready to risk detection by mark. after all, he could hardly get at herhere, and someone else might see her if she signalled. she took off hershoes and stockings and pushed them through the hole in the wall, thenher handkerchief, and finally the white blouse she wore was taken off andthrust out between the stones. she kept her hold upon one of the sleeves,and wedged it down between the wall and the beech root, so that theblouse might hang out on the face of the rock like a flag and catch theattention of some passer-by. from time to time, too, she squeezed herhand through the gap and fluttered her fingers backward and forward. sheknew that the path by the burn ran below, and it was used constantly bythe ghillies and by the household. only of course so early in the morningthere was not likely to be anyone about. and she remembered with asinking heart that people seldom look up as they walk.

Almost a whole minute passes whereby i have a ten ton machine on my foot.

A hole is an opening in or through a particular medium, usually a solid body. Holes occur through natural and artificial processes, and may be useful for various purposes, or may represent a problem needing to be addressed in many fields of engineering. Depending on the material and the placement, a hole may be an indentation in a surface (such as a hole in the ground), or may pass completely through that surface (such as a hole created by a hole puncher in a piece of paper). In engineering, a hole may be blind or through if it is partial or complete depth.

naturally it was very annoying for the cavendishes. the house wasconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently deniedadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,where they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of thehousehold. we all lived in a blast of publicity. the scotland yard mencame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved oftongue. towards what end they were working, we did not know. had theyany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category ofundiscovered crimes?

Let me lay it all out on the table first, so we can get it over with.

"well, of course, guyler doesn't know yet about the chinesedevelopment," said lauriston. "guyler thinks the robbery has been thework of a gang--a clever lot of diamond thieves who knew about stephenpurvis's find of the orange-yellow thing and put in a lot of big workabout getting it when it reached england. and he believes that thatgang has kidnapped levendale, and that stephen purvis is working insecret to get at them. that's guyler's notion, anyhow."

She thinks it is a terrible joke until i point to active crime scene.

on the small round mahogany table that stood in the middle of the roomlay a bible, and a copy of the  st. james's gazette , which was dated aweek back. juliet took it up and read an account of a cricket matchwithout much enthusiasm. then she flung it down and wandered about theroom once more; but she had exhausted all its possibilities; and thoughshe took a volume entitled  causes célèbres  from the shelf, and turnedits pages hopefully, she put it back with a grimace at its dullness and asort of surprise at finding anything drier than the cricket.

I took both pairs out and handed one to my dad to put on.

Took is a variant of the English surname Tooke, originally found predominantly in the East Anglia region of the United Kingdom. 

"i'll tell you how it was," said mrs. salmon, seating herself and showingsigns of a disposition to confidence. "miss chatfield, she'd been here, ithink, three days that time--i'd had her once before a year or twoprevious. one morning--i'm sure it was about the third day that the swayne necklace  company was here--she came in from rehearsal in aregular take-on. she said that her father had just called on her at thetheatre. she said he'd been to falmouth to meet a relation of theirswho'd come from america and had found him to be very ill on landing--soill that a falmouth doctor had given strict orders that he mustn't travelany further than bristol, on his way wherever he wanted to go. they'd gotto bristol and the young man was so done up that mr. chatfield had had todrive him to another doctor--one close by here--dr. valdey--as soon asthey arrived. dr. valdey said he must go to bed at once and have at leasttwo days' complete rest in bed, and he advised mr. chatfield to get quietrooms instead of going to a hotel. so mr. chatfield, knowing that hisdaughter was here, do you see, sought her out and told her all about it.she came to me and asked me if i knew where they could get rooms. wellnow, i had my drawing-room floor empty that week, and as it was only fortwo or three days that they wanted rooms i offered to take mr. chatfieldand the young man in. of course, if i'd known how ill he was, ishouldn't. what i understood--and mind you, i don't say they wilfullydeceived me, for i don't think they did--what i understood was that theyoung man simply wanted a real good rest. but he was evidently a dealworse than what even dr. valdey thought. he'd stopped at dr. valdey'ssurgery while mr. chatfield went to see about rooms, and they moved himfrom there straight in here. and as i say, he was a deal worse than theythought, much worse, and the doctor had to be fetched to him more thanonce during the afternoon. still dr. valdey himself never said to me thatthere was any immediate danger. but that's neither here nor there--theyoung fellow died that night."

Now some background information, i'm a senior in high school with fairly strict parents.

In mathematical writing, the term strict refers to the property of excluding equality and equivalence and often occurs in the context of inequality and monotonic functions. It is often attached to a technical term to indicate that the exclusive meaning of the term is to be understood. The opposite is non-strict, which is often understood to be the case but can be put explicitly for clarity. In some contexts, the word "proper" can also be used as a mathematical synonym for "strict".

 “exceedingly so.”

some months later, when audrey greyle had come into possession ofscarhaven, and had married copplestone in the little church behind hermother's cottage, she and her husband, to satisfy a mutual andlong-cherished desire, visited a certain romantic and retired part of thecountry. and in the course of their wanderings they came across a verypretty village, and in it a charmingly situated retreat, which looked soattractive from the road along which they were walking that they haltedand peered at it through its trimly-kept boundary hedge. and there,seated in the easiest of chairs on the smoothest of lawns, roses abouthim, a cigar in his mouth, the newspaper in his hand, a glass at hiselbow, they saw peter chatfield. they looked at him for a long moment;then they looked at each other and smiled delightedly, as children mightsmile at a pleasure-giving picture, and they passed on in silence. butwhen that village lay behind them, copplestone gave his wife a slyglance, and permitted himself to make an epigram.

Maybe some glasses to look more professional? ok, lets do it.

Glass is a non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid, that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics. Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form; some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are "silicate glasses" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand. Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass. The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology. Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material.

 “i wished mr. acton to be present while i demonstrated this small matter to you,” said holmes, “for it is natural that he should take a keen interest in the details. i am afraid, my dear colonel, that you must regret the hour that you took in such a stormy petrel as i am.”

Just as i closed the trunk and started heading towards the driver's side, my friend didn't close his door so naturally, i closed it for him.

Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord. 

a fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the policecourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. ithad been found in mrs. inglethorp’s cheque book, and on being reversedat a mirror, showed clearly the words: “. . . erything of which i diepossessed i leave to my beloved husband alfred ing...” this placedbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour ofthe deceased lady’s husband. japp then produced the charred fragment ofpaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of thebeard in the attic, completed his evidence.

I checked the inventory sheet, and sure enough, the number of pieces of luggage adds up to include that bag.

mrs. meredith took his homage as a matter of course. she was used toadmiration, though she was not one of those women to whom it isindispensable. she considered it one of the luxuries of life, and heldthat it is more becoming than diamonds and a better protection againstthe weather than the most expensive furs. at first she looked upon theobviously stricken state of sir arthur with amusement, combined with agood deal of gratification that some one should have arisen to entertainher in this dull health resort; but gradually, as the weeks passed, herpoint of view underwent a change. whether it was the boredom of the cure,or whether she was touched by the unselfish devotion of her admirer, orwhether it was due merely to the accident that sir arthur was anuncommonly good-looking young man and so little conscious of the fact,from one cause or another she began to feel for him a friendliness whichgrew quickly more pronounced; so that at the end of a month, when hefound her, for the first time walking alone by the lake, and proposed toher inside the first two minutes of their encounter, she accepted himalmost as promptly, and with very nearly as much enthusiasm.

I pulled an all nighter entirely by accident and then it was sunday.

An accident is an unintended, normally unwanted event that was not directly caused by humans.  The term accident implies that nobody should be blamed, but the event may have been caused by unrecognized or unaddressed risks.  Most researchers who study unintentional injury avoid using the term accident and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.  For example, when a tree falls down during a wind storm, its fall may not have been caused by humans, but the tree's type, size, health, location, or improper maintenance may have contributed to the result.  Most car wrecks are not true accidents; however English speakers started using that word in the mid-20th century as a result of media manipulation by the US automobile industry.

"yes, they have all gone," said juliet. "the men went before it allhappened, and the others the next day. there were lady ruth worsfold andmrs. clutsam; they are both cousins of lord ashiel's, and he lends themlittle houses that belong to him near here, but they were staying at thecastle for a week or two. then there was miss julia romaninov. she ishalf a russian, and lord ashiel's sister, who is away just now, hadinvited her. an american girl, miss tarver, a great heiress, was theretoo. the men were sir george hatch and colonel spicer, who are cousins oflord ashiel's; and mr. mark mcconachan and sir david southern, who arehis nephews, mr. mcconachan being the son of his dead brother, while sirdavid is his younger sister's child.

Now i'm getting ready to start college and all i can think of is that i miss her.

Miss (pronounced ) is an English language honorific traditionally used only for an unmarried woman (not using another title such as "Doctor" or "Dame"). Originating in the 17th century, it is a contraction of mistress, which was used for all women. Its counterparts are Mrs., usually used only for married women, and Ms., which can be used for married or unmarried women.

“here, as we know, i was wrong, and i was forced to abandon that idea.i faced the problem from a new standpoint. now, at four o’clock, dorcasoverheard her mistress saying angrily: ‘you need not think that anyfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.”i conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words wereaddressed, not to her husband, but to mr. john cavendish. at fiveo’clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but thestandpoint is different. she admits to dorcas, ‘i don’t know what todo; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.’ at fouro’clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. at fiveo’clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a greatshock.

The husband keeps asking the wife for a cuddle but she keeps putting him off as there are always more jobs to do.

A husband is a  male in a marital relationship, who may also be referred to as a spouse. The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his spouse and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between societies and cultures, and have varied over time.

it was the first time she had called lauriston by his name, and he gaveher arm an involuntary pressure as they hastened along.

* my favorite stories list where i favorited other authors' works, including sexy times.

Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.

 “‘i don’t think that we should have much difficulty in determining that,’ said i; ‘with your permission we will take the first train down to sussex, and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot.’

My aunt dell is insisting that i'm faking and that she never gave me permission to go in her room.

Permission may be:

edit:

Sir is a formal English honorific address for men, derived from Sire in the High Middle Ages. Traditionally, as governed by law and custom, "Sir" is used for men titled as knights, i.e., of orders of chivalry, and later also applied to baronets and other offices. As the female equivalent for knighthood is damehood, the suo jure female equivalent term is typically Dame. The wife of a knight or baronet tends to be addressed as Lady, although a few exceptions and interchanges of these uses exist.

the same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that thechemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.

I checked my medicine cabinet and all i had in there was isopropyl alcohol 91%, figured good enough.

Medicine is the science and practice of caring for a patient, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment,  palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.

"neither mr. robson nor mr. collingwood know anything whatever about mycoming here!" retorted nesta. "no one knows! i am quite competent tomanage my own affairs--of this sort. i want to know why my mother hasbeen forced into that arrangement with you--for i am sure you haveforced her! if you will not tell me why--then i shall do what i said."

I have forced myself to accept that i will no longer be able to collect his hair to add to the bag.

Forced is a single-player and co-op action role-playing game developed by BetaDwarf, released in October 2013 for Windows, OS X and Linux through the Steam platform as well as Wii U. It is about gladiators fighting for their freedom in a fantasy arena where they are assisted by a spirit-like character called Balfus. Gameplay consists of selecting a weapon class and abilities to combat the various enemies of each arena, while solving puzzles using the help of Balfus. BetaDwarf was formed by a small group of students in 2011, who began developing the game in an unused classroom in Aalborg University – Copenhagen, Denmark. They were removed months later and launched a successful Kickstarter campaign involving an Imgur picture which documented their progress. Forced received moderate to favorable reviews with most critics praising its competitive gameplay and puzzle-system. The game's weak plot, technical glitches and excess difficulty were the negative highlights. It won the Level Up 2013 Intel award and BetaDwarf received the Danish Developer Of The Year (2013) for it.

the man turned and descended several steps of worn and moss-covered stonewhich led through the archway into a dark, cellar-like place smellingstrongly of damp and age. greyle drew the attention of his companions toa heap of earth and rubbish at the entrance.

Anyway, she wants to go out friday night for drinks, then come back to my place to watch movies and "see what happens".

"i have told you before to-day, gimblet, of all that has happened since.how i took passionately to books as a refuge from my sorrow; how, at mygrandfather's suggestion, i had been by way of working for thediplomatic service; of how i now worked in good earnest, and in courseof time, and after my grandfather's death, found myself attached to ourembassy at petersburg. during the two years i spent there i made theacquaintance of countess romaninov. one day when i was talking to hershe happened to mention that she had once known an english lady, mrs.meredith, and i came to the conclusion that the little girl who livedwith her must be none other than my own child. as you know, i could notstand living in the same town as she did, and for that, and for otherreasons, i left the diplomatic service and returned to england, where ihave lived a quiet life on my place in scotland ever since. eight yearsago, as you know, i married for the second time, and after a few yearsof comparative happiness, found myself again a widower, my second wifeand her child dying within a few months of each other, when my boy wasonly four years old.

This little faux pas occured over this passed summer when i worked the front desk of a prestigious hotel.

on september 15th john cavendish appeared in the dock at the oldbailey, charged with “the wilful murder of emily agnes inglethorp,” andpleaded “not guilty.”

Looked at my charges, and my account wasn't charged until the deadline day.

"mr. oliver is not here yet," broke in stafford. "he's late,too--unaccountably late, for him. an appointment, you say?"

My mom is disabled, she broke her neck many years ago.

but mark, to her astonishment, had not drawn away from julia with therepugnance and disgust that were to be expected. instead, he was lookingat her, strangely, indeed, but almost eagerly.

My best friend (we will call her "julia" for the sake of id) has been my friend for 2 years.

Julia is usually a feminine given name. It is a Latinate feminine form of the name Julio and Julius. (For further details on etymology, see the Wiktionary entry "Julius".) The given name Julia had been in use throughout Late Antiquity (e.g. Julia of Corsica) but became rare during the Middle Ages, and was revived only with the Italian Renaissance. It became common in the English-speaking world only in the 18th century. Today, it is frequently used throughout the world.

juliet did not hesitate. she could reach the aperture easily, and itwould have been the simplest thing in the world to climb into it, butfor the yawning chasm beneath. holding firmly to the friendly holly, andresisting, with an effort, the temptation to look down, she swungherself bravely over the edge and scrambled into the hole with a gasp ofrelief. it was, after all, not very difficult. she found herselfstanding within the entrance of a narrow passage built into thethickness of the wall. beside the opening through which she had come, alittle door of oak, grey with age and strengthened with rusty bars andcross-pieces of iron, drooped upon its one remaining hinge. two hugeslabs of stone leaning near it, against the wall, showed how it hadbeen the custom in former centuries to fortify the entrance still moreeffectively in time of danger.

Okay so a alittle back story first.

 “you were satisfied that he could not have been concealed in the room all the time, or in the corridor which you have just described as dimly lighted?”

This story is one of those honest to goodness bathroom fuckups that absolutely cannot happen but do happen because your life is irrelevant.

In a building, a room is any space enclosed within a number of walls to which entry is possible only by a door or other dividing structure that connects it either to a passageway, to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it.

“i should put it this way. the doors  were  bolted—our own eyes havetold us that—yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, andthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someoneentered the room. you agree so far?”

Beside my car was a black man who was getting out of his car -- our driver-side car doors were next to each other.

A door is a hinged or otherwise movable barrier that allows ingress into and egress from an enclosure. The created opening in the wall is a doorway or portal. A door's essential and primary purpose is to provide security by controlling access to the doorway (portal). Conventionally, it is a panel that fits into the portal of a building, room, or vehicle. Doors are generally made of a material suited to the door's task. Doors are commonly attached by hinges, but can move by other means, such as slides or counterbalancing. 

but spurge waved a hand to them to stay where they were. he himself creptalong the back of the hedge until he came to a point opposite the nearestangle of the tower. and suddenly he gave a great cry--human enough thistime!--and the three young men rushing forward found him standing by thebody of a roughly-clad man in whom copplestone recognized the one-eyedodd-job man of the "admiral's arms."

I just got a package in the mail and the instruction manual was enclosed in a plastic bag that was stapled shut.

A man is an adult male human. Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent).

his words gave me an unpleasant shock. miss howard’s evidence,unimportant as it was, had been given in such a downrightstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt hersincerity. still, i had a great respect for poirot’s sagacity—except onthe occasions when he was what i described to myself as “foolishlypig-headed.”

Being a horny 21 year old, i ran right over, and with few words being exchanged, we did what college kids do after a booty call.

In linguistics, a word of a spoken language can be defined as the smallest sequence of phonemes that can be uttered in isolation with objective or practical meaning. In many languages, words also correspond to sequences of graphemes ("letters") in their standard writing systems that are delimited by spaces wider than the normal inter-letter space, or by other graphical conventions. The concept of "word" is usually distinguished from that of a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of word which has a meaning, even if it will not stand on its own together or in other small words.

 i was not surprised. indeed, my only wonder was that he had not already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of england. for a whole day my companion had rambled about the room with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. fresh editions of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner. yet, silent as he was, i knew perfectly well what it was over which he was brooding. there was but one problem before the public which could challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular disappearance of the favourite for the wessex cup, and the tragic murder of its trainer. when, therefore, he suddenly announced his intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only what i had both expected and hoped for.

So i'm driving to work on saturday morning along the frontage road, when i suddenly spot some unusual traffic.

"better send your cab away and come inside until we get some news," hesaid. "let jerramy take your things into his sanctum--he'll keep an eyeon them till you want them--i suppose you'll stop at the 'angel' witholiver. look here!" he went on, turning to the cab driver, "just you waita bit--i might want you; wait ten minutes, anyway. come in, mr.copplestone."

Doctor comes in, says i need stitches.

“in consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly andhurriedly makes a new will. the contents of that will we shall neverknow. she told no one of its provisions. this morning, no doubt, shewould have consulted me on the subject—but she had no chance. the willdisappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. cavendish,i much fear there is no coincidence there. monsieur poirot, i am sureyou agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.”

He was really shallow, too, but i felt bad for him so i let it drag on for a couple of painful months.

Shall and will are two of the English modal verbs. They have various uses, including the expression of propositions about the future, in what is usually referred to as the future tense of English.

 “‘thank you, sir,’ said the seaman, touching his forelock. ‘i’m just off a two-yearer in an eight-knot tramp, short-handed at that, and i wants a rest. i thought i’d get it either with mr. beddoes or with you.’

*“fuck, imadeathrowawayfordeez, you fucking idiot! the one time you don’t have a condom on you a girl wants to have sex with you.

The idea of want can be examined from many perspectives. In secular societies want might be considered similar to the emotion desire, which can be studied scientifically through the disciplines of psychology or sociology. Want might also be examined in economics as a necessary ingredient in sustaining and perpetuating capitalist societies that are organised around principles like consumerism. Alternatively want can be studied in a non-secular, spiritual, moralistic or religious way, particularly by Buddhism but also Christianity, Islam and Judaism.

no questions of any importance were asked of mr. gardiner, and thecoroner, after a short interchange of whispers with his officer,glanced at a group of professional-looking men behind the witness-box.

I don't ask any questions or anything and just go back to enjoy my now cold burger and warm shake.

A question is an utterance which typically functions as a request for information, which is expected to be provided in the form of an answer. Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered.

but his most careful tappings and testings could discover no hiddenspring, nor, even by the help of the electric torch--which he passed allover the smooth surfaces of the walls--could he discern the slightestjoin or crack. could there be a hiding place up among the wheels of themotionless works? his utmost endeavours could discover none. the clockwas fully eight feet high, but with the help of a stool, which he putinside on the floor of the case, he was able to explore even the topmostcorners. all to no purpose.

My stupid self responded with "no" and opened them only to discover what appeared to be completely filled bikini/lingerie pictures of her.

 “the paper! of course!” yelled holmes, in a paroxysm of excitement. “idiot that i was! i thought so much of our visit that the paper never entered my head for an instant. to be sure, the secret must be there.” he flattened it out upon the table, and a cry of triumph burst from his lips. “look at this, watson,” he cried. “it is a london paper, an early edition of the  evening standard . here is what we want. look at the headlines: ‘crime in the city. murder at mawson & williams’. gigantic attempted robbery. capture of the criminal.’ here, watson, we are all equally anxious to hear it, so kindly read it aloud to us.”

We are both going away and visiting our parents for a week starting next friday for christmas.

"i will, an' all--wi' pleasure," said the landlord, "but ye mun hev adrop o' summat first--try a glass o' our ale," he went on, with trueyorkshire hospitality. "i hev some bitter beer i' my cellar such as i'lllay owt ye couldn't get t' likes on down yonder i' barford--no, nor i'london neyther!--i'll just draw a jug."

I went to the atm to withdraw $100.

since it was no use denying the murder, he seemed to find some sort ofsatisfaction in telling julia of his other crimes. and yet, though hetried hard to speak with an affectation of indifference, it was plainthat he kept a watchful eye upon his listener, and was ready to fastenresentfully upon the first sign of horror, or even disapproval. for allhis efforts, the tone of his disclosures was at once swaggering andsuspicious; but he need have had no anxiety as to the spirit in whichthey would be received. it was clear that julia brought to his judgmentno remembrance of ordinary human standards of conduct. to her he wasabove such criticisms, as the immortals might be supposed to be abovethe rules that applied to dwellers upon earth. what he did was right inher eyes, because he did it, and she admired his brutality, as she adoredthe rest of him, whole-heartedly, without reservation.

I end up pulling up too fast, undoing the grip the bar had on the door and plummeting 5 feet to the hard tile floor beneath me.

she had but one thought; it was for him, and he who ran might read itshining in the depths of her great eyes. after a few minutes of sulking,mark relented.

Anyway, so we're having a great conversation, smoked a bit, played cards, and it was all completely platonic.

"i have left the castle, and am staying with lady ruth worsfold, whosehouse you can just see through the trees," she said. "will you come therefirst, or shall we go straight to the castle. it is about a mile throughthe woods."

The valve just disappeared.

 in glancing over the somewhat incoherent series of memoirs with which i have endeavoured to illustrate a few of the mental peculiarities of my friend mr. sherlock holmes, i have been struck by the difficulty which i have experienced in picking out examples which shall in every way answer my purpose. for in those cases in which holmes has performed some  tour-de-force  of analytical reasoning, and has demonstrated the value of his peculiar methods of investigation, the facts themselves have often been so slight or so commonplace that i could not feel justified in laying them before the public. on the other hand, it has frequently happened that he has been concerned in some research where the facts have been of the most remarkable and dramatic character, but where the share which he has himself taken in determining their causes has been less pronounced than i, as his biographer, could wish. the small matter which i have chronicled under the heading of “a study in scarlet,” and that other later one connected with the loss of the  gloria scott , may serve as examples of this scylla and charybdis which are forever threatening the historian. it may be that in the business of which i am now about to write the part which my friend played is not sufficiently accentuated; and yet the whole train of circumstances is so remarkable that i cannot bring myself to omit it entirely from this series.

Much of what i read suggest taking the ipod apart before putting it in rice so the water can get sufficiently absorbed.

but even at that moment--and not from any coincidence, but from the lawof probability to which mr. killick had appealed--information on thatvery point was close at hand. a constable tapped at the door, andentering, whispered a few words to the chief official, who havingwhispered back, turned to the rest as the man went out of the room.

And then roll around reciting a rosary of curse words and not the same word twice.

these valuables lay, carelessly displayed, on the table when the partyfrom pilmansey's tea rooms came tumbling into the shop and the parlour,an hour later. melky was calmly smoking a cigar--and he went on smokingit as he led the inspector and his men upstairs to the prisoner. hecould not deprive himself of the pleasure of a dig at ayscough.

So just this evening, i was rushing home on foot with my family's dinner and i came to this pedestrian crossing.

A came is a divider bar used between small pieces of glass to make a larger glazing panel.

yada, left to himself, had spent his time in gazing out of the dirtywindow of his prison. there was not much of a prospect. the windowcommanded the various backyards of that quarter. as if to consider anypossible chance of escape, he looked out. there was a projectionbeneath him, a convenient water-pipe--he might make a perilous descent,if need arose. but, somehow, he believed in that little jew: hebelieved, much more, in the little jew's greed for a hundred pounds ofready money. the little jew with the cunning smile had seen his chanceof making a quiet penny, and had taken it--it was all right, said yada,all right. and yet, there was one horrible thought--supposing, now thatmelky had got the cheque, that he cashed it and made off with all themoney, never to return?

I had planned to go to georgia aquarium on the sunday, but it would now be spent shopping for work clothes sigh!

happy ending, at least for me.

"he was, really. for he joined the 'friends of man' when he was at thebritish embassy at petersburg long years ago; and no sooner had he beeninitiated than he turned round and denounced the society and all itsworks. worse still, he declared his intention of hindering it fromcarrying out its programme. he would have been got rid of there andthen, but as ill-luck would have it he had, by an unheard-of chain ofaccidents, become possessed of an important document belonging to thesociety. it was, indeed, a list of the principal people on the executivecommittee that fell into his hands, and he took the precaution ofsending it to england, with instructions that if anything happened tohim it should be forwarded to the russian police, before he made knownhis ridiculous objections to our programme. here, as you willunderstand, was a most impossible situation with which there wasapparently no means of coping.

So i continued, albeit putting precautions (towels, blankets, etc) on my bed.

“come, my friend,” he said, changing the subject, “apart from mr.inglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?”

"

we start exchanging pleasantries.

meanwhile, there was something he himself wanted to do, and on themorning following his arrival in the town, he set out to do it. bynerhad been much struck by pickard's account of his dealings with jamesparrawhite on the evening which appeared to be the very last whereinparrawhite was ever seen. he had watched the landlord of the  green man closely as he told his story, and had set him down for an honest, ifsomewhat sly and lumpish soul, who was telling a plain tale to the bestof his ability. byner believed all the details of that story--he evenbelieved that when parrawhite told pickard that he would find him fiftypounds that evening, or early next day, he meant to keep his word. inthe circumstances--as far as byner could reckon them up from what he hadgathered--it would not have paid parrawhite to do otherwise. byner putthe situation to himself in this fashion--pratt had got hold of somesecret which was being, or could be made to be, highly profitable tohim. parrawhite had discovered this, and was in a position to blackmailpratt. therefore parrawhite would not wish to leave pratt'sneighbourhood--so long as there was money to be got out of pratt,parrawhite would stick to him like a leech. but if parrawhite was toabide peaceably in barford, he must pay pickard that little matter ofbetween fifty and sixty pounds. accordingly, in byner's opinion,parrawhite had every honest intention of returning to the  green man  onthe evening of the twenty-third of november after having seen pratt.and, in byner's further--and very seriously considered--opinion, thewhole problem for solution--possibly involving the solution of other andmore important problems--was this: did parrawhite meet pratt that night,and if he did what took place between them which prevented parrawhitefrom returning to pickard?

We set them up on a double date together and all went out, had plenty to drink and a great time and then came back to my apartment for the night.

 “‘very likely not. it has been kept very quiet, for the capital was all privately subscribed, and it’s too good a thing to let the public into. my brother, harry pinner, is promoter, and joins the board after allotment as managing director. he knew i was in the swim down here, and asked me to pick up a good man cheap. a young, pushing man with plenty of snap about him. parker spoke of you, and that brought me here to-night. we can only offer you a beggarly five hundred to start with.’

When i took it off to explain (they all spoke zero english) they all tried to ask me questions to the best of their ability.

A spoke is one of some number of rods radiating from the center of a wheel (the hub where the axle connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface.

"drains, that's what it is," he would say to some of the passengers towhom he confided the altered state of his health on board the boat whichcarried him to constantinople. "as soon as i get back to a civilizedsewage system i shall be myself again. these eastern towns are all rightfor orientals; and what is your muscovite but an oriental, in allessentials of hygiene? but they play the deuce with a european who hasgrown up in a country where people still indulge in a sense of smell."

All night people were sneaking in my room to trying to puke their guts out in my private or trying to make me lose my temper by being in my room.

A people is any plurality of persons considered as a whole.

"but--what did we intend to do? i tell you, not being aware that olddaniel multenius had met his death by violence, we did not give onesecond's thought to that aspect and side of the affair--we concentratedon the recovery of our property. i knew the house in which thesechinese lived. that evening, purvis and i went there. we have both beenaccustomed, in our time, to various secret dealings and manoeuvres, andwe entered the grounds of that house without any one being the wiser.it did not take long to convince us that the house was empty. itremained empty that night--purvis kept guard over it, in an outhouse inthe garden. no one either entered or left it between our going to itand purvis coming away from it next morning--he stayed there, watchinguntil it was time to keep an appointment with me in hyde park. before imet him, i had been called upon by detective ayscough, mr. rubinstein,and mr. lauriston--they know what i said to them. i could not at thattime say anything else--i had my own concerns to think of.

I looked under the mats, pulled out every piece of paper in the glove box, opened it, and kept tearing through.

Kept is a reality television series that centered on Jerry Hall (model and ex-wife to Mick Jagger) searching for a kept man. The show premiered on the American cable network VH1 in late May 2005. When Hall narrowed the list down to twelve, she spirited them off to London and eliminated them one by one.

he led the way amongst the disused quarries, and byner, following,climbed on a mound, now grown over with grass and weed, and looked abouthim. to his town eyes the place was something novel. he had never seenthe like of it before. gradually he began to understand it. the stonehad been torn out of the earth, sometimes in square pits, sometimes insemi-circular ones, until the various veins and strata had becomeexhausted. then, when men went away, nature had stepped in to assert herrights. all over the despoiled region she had spread a new clothing ofgreen. turf had grown on the flooring of the quarries; ivy and bramblehad covered the deep scars; bushes had sprung up; trees were alreadyspringing. and in one of the worn-out excavations some man had planted akitchen-garden in orderly and formal rows and plots.

As soon as i stepped into the bathroom i forgot my primary mission.

it may be imagined with what amazement and growing horror juliet listenedto this avowal. that julia, the girl with whom she had associated onterms of easy familiarity which had been near to becoming something likeintimacy in the close contact and companionship of a country-house life,that this girl, an honoured guest in lord ashiel's house, should havegained her footing there for her own treacherous ends, or at the biddingof a band of political assassins! juliet could scarcely believe her earsas she heard the calm, indifferent tone in which julia spoke of thedrawbacks to "getting rid" of lord ashiel, and of the contemplated"accident" which was to have befallen him. she would have fled from whereshe stood, if mingled fear and curiosity to hear more had not rooted herto the spot. her alarm was tempered by the presence of mark. if this girlshould discover her hiding there and show signs of the violence thatmight be expected from such a character, mark would be there to protecther. she could trust him to know how to deal with the russian, whose truenature must now be apparent to him.

Waited

the music got louder all the sudden, i thought, "oh lord, i must be wrong with all this"

so i decided to knock another 3 consecutive times.

Lord is an appellation for a person or deity who has authority, control, or power over others, acting as a master, a chief, or a ruler. The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the peerage in the United Kingdom, or are entitled to courtesy titles. The collective "Lords" can refer to a group or body of peers.

closing the trap-door, and making sure that everything in the library wasleft as he had found it, gimblet made his exit from the castle in thesame manner as he had entered it, and groped his silent way home throughthe darkness.

Having just made a fool of myself, my mother laughs in a loud, over-the-top, artificial manner: **ha ha ha ha haaaa.

 “hum! the investigation really was a very simple one,” remarked holmes, “but i don’t think it struck him in that light when he first called us in. however, let us see what jim browner has to say for himself. this is his statement as made before inspector montgomery at the shadwell police station, and it has the advantage of being verbatim.”

Admittedly, i always skirt around it, never really crossing over but i do it to troll my coworkers from time to time.

from the quickness with which lord ashiel answered her, he might havebeen sitting waiting at the end of the wire, and he expressed greatpleasure at her acceptance of his invitation. indeed, she could hear fromthe tone of his voice that his gratification was no mere empty form. itwas arranged that she should travel down on the following night, lordashiel promising to engage a sleeping berth for her on the eight o'clocktrain. he himself was going north that same evening. he had just beenwriting a letter to sir arthur byrne, he told her. he hoped she had somethick dresses with her; she would want them in scotland.

You'll probably be seeing me on r/talesfromthefrontdesk once i find something else.

 “i was, as watson may have told you, in the foreign office, and through the influences of my uncle, lord holdhurst, i rose rapidly to a responsible position. when my uncle became foreign minister in this administration he gave me several missions of trust, and as i always brought them to a successful conclusion, he came at last to have the utmost confidence in my ability and tact.

Usually, the landlord just puts flyers in everyone's doors or sticks something between the cracks so i paid it no mind.

he led the way into the hotel, through the hall, and down a corridorfrom which several reception rooms opened. looking into one, a smallsmoking lounge, and finding it empty, he ushered them aside. but on thethreshold zillah paused. her business instincts were by this time fullyaroused. she felt certain that whoever this stranger might he, he hadnothing to do with the affair in praed street, and yet might be able tothrow extraordinary light on it, and she wanted to take a great steptowards clearing it up. she turned to the american.

I thought that i had chosen that same one tonight, because when i turned on the water it came on.

it may be imagined with what amazement and growing horror juliet listenedto this avowal. that julia, the girl with whom she had associated onterms of easy familiarity which had been near to becoming something likeintimacy in the close contact and companionship of a country-house life,that this girl, an honoured guest in lord ashiel's house, should havegained her footing there for her own treacherous ends, or at the biddingof a band of political assassins! juliet could scarcely believe her earsas she heard the calm, indifferent tone in which julia spoke of thedrawbacks to "getting rid" of lord ashiel, and of the contemplated"accident" which was to have befallen him. she would have fled from whereshe stood, if mingled fear and curiosity to hear more had not rooted herto the spot. her alarm was tempered by the presence of mark. if this girlshould discover her hiding there and show signs of the violence thatmight be expected from such a character, mark would be there to protecther. she could trust him to know how to deal with the russian, whose truenature must now be apparent to him.

Baffled, i took a close look and found a little arrow pointing to 3 of the 4 edges with instructions to tear along the perforated line.

Fled is a 1996 American buddy action comedy film directed by Kevin Hooks. It stars Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin as two prisoners chained together who flee during an escape attempt gone bad.

as we went home, mary cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecutingcounsel.

All was well and he went to sleep.

Went can mean:

 “yes, but she is a good sort, or i am mistaken. she and her brother are the only children of an iron-master somewhere up northumberland way. he got engaged to her when traveling last winter, and she came down to be introduced to his people, with her brother as escort. then came the smash, and she stayed on to nurse her lover, while brother joseph, finding himself pretty snug, stayed on too. i’ve been making a few independent inquiries, you see. but to-day must be a day of inquiries.”

This task can be kinda hard to do when my sister and future brother in law are kinda against smoking weed.

A brother is a man or boy who shares one or more parents with another, a sibling. The female counterpart is a sister. Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships. A full brother is a first degree relative.

“tcha! tcha!” cried poirot irritably. “you argue like a child. if misshoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quiteequally capable of simulating devotion. no, we must look elsewhere. youare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence againstalfred inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrongin the deduction you draw from it. i have drawn my own deductions,which i believe to be correct, but i will not speak of them atpresent.” he paused a minute, then went on. “now, to my way ofthinking, there is one insuperable objection to miss howard’s being themurderess.”

She parks a few streets away from my house and starts making out with me, no real objections from me.

"i suppose i must tell you," she murmured; "it's not that i don't wantto. but they would kill me if they knew. oh, mark, i ought not to tellyou, but how can i keep anything secret from my beloved? swear to methat you will never repeat it, or try to hinder me in what i have to do?"

I swear to god i am breathing fire.

"i do," exclaimed ayscough. "a chinaman--a diamond worth every penny ofeighty thousand pounds--ah!" he suddenly lifted his eyes to yada with aquick enquiry. "how much do you know of these two?" he asked.

It was a brief moment of us looking into eachothers eyes while i held her breasts.

Eyes are organs of the visual system. They provide animals with vision, the ability to receive and process visual detail, as well as enabling several photo response functions that are independent of vision. Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons. In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain. Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system. Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods.The most simple eyes, pit eyes, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light. From more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex.

"supposition that you'll find to be absolute truth, my good friend!"retorted mirandolet, calmly. "i know the chinese--better than youthink. as soon as i heard of this affair tonight, i came to you to putyou up to the chinese trick of secreting things of value in theirpigtails--it did not occur to me that the diamond might be there inthis case, but i thought you would probably find something. but when wereached this mortuary, and i heard that a japanese had been here,presenting your card when he had no business to present it, i guessedimmediately what had happened--and now that you tell me that you toldhim all about this affair, well--i am certain of my assertion. mr.detective--go after the diamond!"

Mildly infuriated, i roll my eyes as i discard the old cup and wait for the hot water to fully cycle again.

"just so, sir! and at first," said pickard, with a shake of the head,"at first i'd no great reason to grumble. he cert'ny wor a good hand atspottin' a winner. but as time went on, i' t' greatest difficulty ingettin' a settlement wi' him, d'ye see? he wor just as good a hand atmakin' excuses as he wor at pickin' out winners--better, i think! inivver knew wheer i was wi' him--he'd pay up, and then he'd persuade meto go in for another do wi' t' brass i'd won, and happen we should losethat time, and then of course we had to hev another investment to getback what we'd dropped, and so it went on. but t' end wor thishere--last november theer wor about fifty to sixty pound o' mine i' hishands, and i wanted it. i'd a spirit merchant's bill to settle, and iwanted t' brass badly for that. i knew parrawhite had been paid, d'yesee, by t' turf agent, 'at he betted wi', and i plagued him to hand t'brass over to me. he made one excuse and then another--howsumivver, itcome to that very day you're talkin' about i' your advertisement, mr.eldrick--the twenty-third o' november----"

After redditing this long i should know to always have a plunger! sod it, it's been a long day i use my hand to shift the blockage.

A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each "hand" and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having "hands" instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described as having "hands" though opposable thumbs are lacking.Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally — for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.The human hand usually has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers. It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone, the number of which varies among people, 14 of which are the phalanges (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers and thumb. The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist. Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.

"well, the money will be very useful to poor david," said mrs. clutsam,without turning her head. she was rather annoyed because she had foundthat she had written "i am so glad you can kill pigs," instead of "i amso glad you can come" to some one she had invited to stay with her.

Edit:  i used my words poorly.

Poverty is the state of having little material possessions or income. Poverty can have diverse social, economic, and political causes and effects. When evaluating poverty in statistics or economics there are two main measures: Absolute poverty measures compare income against the amount needed to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter. Relative poverty measures when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place. Thus relative poverty is defined varies from one country to another, or from one society to another.Statistically, as of 2019, most people on the planet live in poverty: (in Purchasing Power Parity dollars) 85% live on less than $30 per day, two-thirds live on less than $10 per day, and 10% live on less than $1.90 per day (extreme poverty). Even when countries experience economic development, the poorest citizens of middle-income countries frequently do not gain an adequate share of their countries’ increased wealth to leave poverty. Governments and non-governmental organizations have experimented with a number of different policies and programs  for poverty alleviation, such as electrification in rural areas or housing first policies in urban areas. The international policy frameworks for poverty alleviation is summarized in Sustainable Development Goal 1: "No Poverty".

“in that case, is it not possible that the articles in question mighthave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quiteunaware of their presence?”

The thing is literally making it impossible to poop.

Possibility is the condition or fact of being possible. Latin origins of the word hint at ability.

gilling's cheerful optimism was the sort of desirable quality that is agood thing to have, but all the optimism in the world is valueless inface of impregnable difficulty. and the difficulty of tracing chatfieldand his sick companion in a city the size of bristol did indeed seemimpregnable when gilling and copplestone had been attacking it fortwenty-four hours. they had spent a whole day in endeavouring to getnews; they had gone in and out of hotels until they were sick of thesight of one; they had made exhaustive inquiries at the railway stationand of the cabmen who congregated there; nobody remembered anything atall about a big, heavy-faced man and a man in his company who seemed tobe very ill. and on the second night copplestone intimated plainly thatin his opinion they were wasting their time.

My romantical companion from the next town over is currently digging himself out of his own driveway and facing unplowed roads.

at last the girl could stand it no longer. her patience was exhausted.curiosity urged her like a goad; and, if she had not much expectation ofmaking any important discovery, she was at least determined to solve themystery that now perplexed her.

A friend urged me to post on here, so i'm not sure if it's 100% appropriate for this sub but here it goes.

the landlady, whose face expressed more and more concern as staffordspoke, shook her head.

Apparently my face when it shattered was priceless.

The face is the front of an animal's head that features three of the head's sense organs, the eyes, nose, and mouth, and through which animals express many of their emotions. The face is crucial for human identity, and damage such as scarring or developmental deformities affects the psyche adversely.

"no other man could," juliet amended. in spite of herself she was sorryfor the girl, whose stricken face showed plainly the anguish she wasundergoing. "forget him, julia; he is not worthy to tie your shoe-lace.he came to me after they had taken david away, and asked me first if iwould take his inheritance even though i couldn't prove my birth, whichhe must have known perfectly that i should never dream of doing, and thenproposed i should marry him, saying that he was very fond of me, and thatin that way justice would be done as regards lord ashiel's money,however things turned out for me. i thought it honourable and generous atthe time, and so did lady ruth when i told her--oh yes, she knows aboutit and can tell you it is true--but now i see that all he wanted was tobe on the safe side, and, if i had accepted him and had turned out tohave no claim upon his uncle's fortune, he would have broken theengagement on some easy pretext. can you deny it?" she demanded of mark.

Flash forward five minutes later, and my minion is frantically running up to my desk to tell me to recall that message.

"not much," replied guyler. "but i'm open to tell what i do know. i'vebeen a bit of a rolling stone, do you see--knocked about the world,pretty considerable, doing one thing and another, and i've falsifiedthe old saying, for i've contrived to gather a good bit of moss in myrollings. well, now, i was located in cape town for a while, some fiveyears ago, and i met spencer levendale there. he was then a dealer indiamonds--can't say in what way exactly--for i never exactly knew--butit was well known that he'd made a big pile, buying and selling thesegoods, and he was a very rich man. now i and five other men--all ofdifferent nationalities--were very useful to levendale in a big dealthat he was anxious to carry through--never mind what it was--and hefelt pretty grateful to us, i reckon. and as we were all warmish men sofar as money was concerned, it wasn't the sort of thing that he couldhand out cheques for, so he hit on the notion of having sets of studsmade of platinum--which is, as you're aware, the most valuable metalknown, and on every stud he had a device of his own invention carefullyengraved. here's my set!--and what mr. rubinstein's got there is partof another. now, then, who's the man who's been dropping his cuff-linksabout?"

Needless to say when i tried to register i was not allowed, i contacted the organizers of the la marathon and got a sorry.

gimblet measured it with painstaking precision; then with the help ofhis measurements, he made a life-size diagram of it on the page of hisnotebook, and studied it with an expression of annoyance. he had seldomfelt more at a loss to explain anything. at length he turned and wentback towards the grass.

Then my mom hollered at me saying, "lossunday, get the fuck over here"
i immediately pulled my pants on and ran to the living room.

 the train had already begun to move as holmes spoke. glancing back, i saw a tall man pushing his way furiously through the crowd, and waving his hand as if he desired to have the train stopped. it was too late, however, for we were rapidly gathering momentum, and an instant later had shot clear of the station.

As i prised the buttons off it became rapidly more obvious that black plastic was blocking it.

 “it is fairly complete in essentials. we know who the author of the revolting business is, although one of the victims still escapes us. of course, you have formed your own conclusions.”

He wouldn't leave and kept on trying to get my business.

Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). Simply put, it is "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit."Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business.  If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions.  A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.

"i thought it was another of those newspaper fellows, but, thankgoodness, i believe they're all gone now," he said. "i am exceedinglyglad to see you, mr. gimblet. i should myself have asked you to come toour aid, but i found that miss byrne had been before me. i suppose youhave seen her?"

The clone was gone and i never had to talk about this with my mom or think about this ever again.

“is soldiering your regular profession, mr. hastings?”

Now mind you that this is not just regular hair, but the fucking amazon jungle of pubes.

"here, give me that bird, maisie," said david rather abruptly. "i'llknock it on the head."

Apparently i am allergic to david beckham cologne.

David (; Hebrew: דָּוִד‎, Modern: Davīd, Tiberian: Dāwīḏ) is described in the Hebrew Bible as a king of the United Monarchy of Israel and Judah. In the Books of Samuel, David is a young shepherd who gains fame first as a musician and later by killing the giant Goliath, a champion of the Philistines in southern Canaan. David becomes a favourite of the first king of united Israel, Saul, and forges a close friendship with Jonathan, a son of Saul. Out of suspicion that David is seeking to usurp the throne, Saul attempts to kill David, forcing the latter to go into hiding and operate as a fugitive for several years. After Saul and Jonathan are both killed in battle against the Philistines, a 30-year-old David is anointed king over all of Israel and Judah, following which he conquers the city of Jerusalem, establishes it as Israel's capital, and takes the Ark of the Covenant into the city to be the centre-point of worship in the Israelite religion.

"it was his wish that we should be married when i was twenty-five andthe girl eighteen; but i was not yet twenty-two, so that there were atleast three years of grace before he could begin to try and impose hisdesign upon us. and he was old and ill, and i had heard that the doctorsdidn't give him more than a year or two, at most, to live. i thoughtthat if juliana and i were married secretly he would die before thequestion of my marriage had time to become one of practical politics;and i persuaded her to agree to a private marriage, which we wouldannounce to the world as soon as my eccentric old grandfather was safelyout of it. there was no possible obstacle to our marriage except the oldman's domineering temper. juliana sandfort was my superior in everypossible sense, worldly or otherwise; but i came of a good family, wasto inherit an old name and title, and a more than sufficient fortune solong as i kept on the right side of the old lord, and we both knew thatthere was no objection to be feared from her relations or from any otherone of mine. in short, much as she disliked doing things in thathole-and-corner sort of way, and ashamed as i was at heart of asking herto, we neither of us could see much actual harm in the idea, and we weremarried accordingly at a registry office in london. everything wouldhave been well, and all would have gone as we hoped, but for the oneunforeseen and horrible calamity. my wife died six months before mygrandfather, on the day her baby was born."

 “i had a little talk with old cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime. he was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else’s brains if he could have got to his revolver. when cunningham saw that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of everything. it seems that william had secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made their raid upon mr. acton’s, and having thus got them into his power, proceeded, under threats of exposure, to levy blackmail upon them. mr. alec, however, was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with. it was a stroke of positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he feared. william was decoyed up and shot, and had they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion might never have been aroused.”

To any future fathers who read this, never, and i mean never spill pumped breast milk.

The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of a primate's torso. In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants. Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development in female humans and to a much lesser extent in other primates.  Breast development in other primate females generally only occurs with pregnancy.

an assistant from parkson’s, theatrical costumiers, testified that onjune 29th, they had supplied a black beard to mr. l. cavendish, asrequested. it was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.no, they had not kept the letter. all transactions were entered intheir books. they had sent the beard, as directed, to “l. cavendish,esq., styles court.”

I trim the beard, and take care of my nails.

A beard is the hair that grows on the jaw, chin, upper lip, lower lip, cheeks, and neck of humans and some non-human animals. In humans, usually pubescent or adult males are able to grow beards. Some women with hirsutism, a hormonal condition of excessive hairiness, may develop a beard.

"none!--that i know of," she answered. "i've helped my grandfather inthis business for some time. i never heard him mention mr. levendale.mr. levendale never came here, certainly."

Yes you heard me kilobits.

"lady ruth had got up, and was moving towards the door, and the othergirls and i were following her, when he called her back. 'will you wait aminute, ruth,' he said. 'i have something to tell you and my youngfriends here.' he smiled round at all of us, including sir david, to whomhe hadn't spoken since the affair of the dog. 'i have some good newswhich i want you to share with me.' he took me by the hand and drew meforward. 'i want,' said he, 'to introduce you all to a young lady whomyou do not know. this is juliet mcconachan, my dear and only daughter.'

I decided to be a nice son and introduce him to the delights of the pornhub network.

like him, she seated herself against the tree trunk at the giddy brink ofthe precipitous rock; like him, her eyes rested on the smooth watersbelow her, or on the far-away misty distance where crianan slumbered;but, unlike him, her eyes, as they looked, were filled with tears. wherewas he now? oh, david, poor unjustly treated david! in what narrow cell,lighted only by a high, iron-barred window--for so the scene shapeditself in her mind--with uncovered floor of stone, bare walls and a benchto lie on, was the man she loved wearing away his days under the burdenof so frightful an accusation?

All i have is a smoothie and my phone during these trying times.

pratt had already realized that this fellow knew something. parrawhite'smanner was not only threatening but confident. he spoke as a man speakswho has got the whip hand. and so, still growling, and inwardly ragingand anxious, he turned off with his companion into a track which layamongst the stone quarries. it was a desolate, lonely place; no housewas near; they were as much alone as if they had been in the middle ofone of the great moors outside the town, the lights of which they couldsee in the valley below them. in the grey sky above, a waning moon gavethem just sufficient light to see their immediate surroundings--agrass-covered track, no longer used, and the yawning mouths of the oldquarries, no longer worked, the edges of which were thick with gorse andbramble. it was the very place for secret work, and pratt was certainthat secret work was at hand.

He did not see the hair, as the nair had removed the longer strands attached and the knot had become embedded in my skin.

"Longer" is a song written and recorded by the American singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg and released in 1979 by Full Moon Records and Epic Records. The song can be found on Fogelberg's 1979 album Phoenix. It was also included on his 1982 greatest hits album as well as various other retrospective and compilation recordings.

 “we have here the explanation of why john straker wished to take the horse out on to the moor. so spirited a creature would have certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick of the knife. it was absolutely necessary to do it in the open air.”

Aroused.

 “i had a little talk with old cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime. he was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else’s brains if he could have got to his revolver. when cunningham saw that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of everything. it seems that william had secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made their raid upon mr. acton’s, and having thus got them into his power, proceeded, under threats of exposure, to levy blackmail upon them. mr. alec, however, was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with. it was a stroke of positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he feared. william was decoyed up and shot, and had they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion might never have been aroused.”

You see, police in india are little corrupt sh*ts and they will not move their arse until they can extort any money from you.

"the next thing i remember was looking up into the anxious friendly faceof andrew campbell, one of the ghillies at inverashiel. it seemed to behanging above me in the sky, which was the only other thing i could see,and i wondered vaguely why i saw it upside down. my head was achingcruelly and i couldn't imagine what was the matter, though i was too weakand faint to care. to cut my adventure short, andrew had come to a poollower down the river just as i floated into it on top of the current; hehad fished me out, and was now restoring me to life again. i was got backto the house, how i hardly know, put to bed, and actually wept over bylord ashiel. by the evening i had so far recovered that i was able tocome down to dinner, though i should not have done so if it had not beenfor the anxiety of my host, as my head still felt as if it was going tosplit. i received many congratulations on my escape, and lord ashiel,when he spoke of it, was so much moved that every one was quiteembarrassed, and i myself was touched beyond expression at the affectionhe did not attempt to conceal. he was very silent after that, but inspite of him dinner that night was a merry meal. every one was in thebest of spirits, or else assumed them for the time being. we all jokedand laughed over my adventure, and mr. mcconachan said i bore a charmedlife, since i had escaped being killed by his careless shot, and now theriver refused to drown me. it was not till the servants had left theroom, and we were preparing to do the same, that lord ashiel spoke again.

As i write this i can only imagine her father's anger, and her tears.

next, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuringhimself that the bolt had really been shot. then he went to the dooropposite leading into cynthia’s room. that door was also bolted, as ihad stated. however, he went to the length of unbolting it, and openingand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precautionagainst making any noise. suddenly something in the bolt itself seemedto rivet his attention. he examined it carefully, and then, nimblywhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out someminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.

So i go back to the machine gun tactic, until i suddenly go into reflex mode for some reason.

 “at last i saw a vacancy at mawson & williams’, the great stockbroking firm in lombard street. i daresay e.c. is not much in your line, but i can tell you that this is about the richest house in london. the advertisement was to be answered by letter only. i sent in my testimonial and application, but without the least hope of getting it. back came an answer by return, saying that if i would appear next monday i might take over my new duties at once, provided that my appearance was satisfactory. no one knows how these things are worked. some people say that the manager just plunges his hand into the heap and takes the first that comes. anyhow it was my innings that time, and i don’t ever wish to feel better pleased. the screw was a pound a week rise, and the duties just about the same as at coxon’s.

My *assets* are more *bigger* than the 'average' and i've always worn loose-fitting clothing to keep my appearance decent and presentable.

the cart jogged off to the sound of a chorus of thanks, and lady ruth andgimblet started down the heather-grown path. they rounded the corners ofthe deserted fold, and walked on into the golden mist of sunset whichspread in front of them, enveloping and dazzling. the clouds of themorning had rolled silently away to the horizon, the wind had dropped toa mere capful; and the midges were abroad in their hosts, rejoicing inthe improvement in the weather.

He proceeds to ask my age, i tell the truth and say 17.

 “i was confined to the house by a severe chill for three days last week. i thought, however, that i had cast off every trace of it.”

I traced the connection and found yet another suspicious device in the network - a proxy server.

 “i went as far as the crystal palace, spent an hour in the grounds, and was back in norbury by one o’clock. it happened that my way took me past the cottage, and i stopped for an instant to look at the windows, and to see if i could catch a glimpse of the strange face which had looked out at me on the day before. as i stood there, imagine my surprise, mr. holmes, when the door suddenly opened and my wife walked out.

This actually happened yesterday, but yeah.

The word day has a number of meanings, depending on the context it is used such as of astronomy, physics, and various calendar systems.   

 it is indeed, a fearful place. the torrent, swollen by the melting snow, plunges into a tremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house. the shaft into which the river hurls itself is an immense chasm, lined by glistening coal-black rock, and narrowing into a creaming, boiling pit of incalculable depth, which brims over and shoots the stream onward over its jagged lip. the long sweep of green water roaring forever down, and the thick flickering curtain of spray hissing forever upward, turn a man giddy with their constant whirl and clamour. we stood near the edge peering down at the gleam of the breaking water far below us against the black rocks, and listening to the half-human shout which came booming up with the spray out of the abyss.

Well she was in a rush to get to a meeting so she didn't say much but i'm fearful of what is to come.

Fear is an intensely unpleasant emotion in response to perceiving or recognizing a danger or threat. Fear causes physiological changes that may produce behavioral reactions such as mounting an aggressive response or fleeing the threat. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a certain stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to oneself. The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis.

"best place on this coast--seashore and inland," said spurge. "and as youtwo london gentlemen doesn't know it, i'll tell you about it. if you wasto go out o' scarhaven harbour and turn north, you'd sail along our coastline up here to the mouth of norcaster bay and you'd think there wasnever an inlet between 'em. but there is. about half-way betweenscarhaven and norcaster there's a very narrow opening in the cliffs thatyou'd never notice unless you were close in shore, and inside thatopening there's a cove that's big enough to take a thousand-tonvessel--aye, and half-a-dozen of 'em! it was a favourite place forsmugglers in the old days, and they call it darkman's dene to this day inmemory of a famous old smuggler that used it a good deal. well, now, atthe land end of that cove there's a narrow valley that runs up to themoorland and the hills, full o' rocks and crags and precipices and suchlike--something o' the same sort as hobkin's hole but a deal wilder, andthat's known as the reaver's glen, because in other days thecattle-lifters used to bring their stolen goods, cattle and sheep, downthere where they could pen 'em in, as it were. there's piles o' places inthat glen where a man can hide--i picked out one right at the top, at theedge of the moors, where there's the ruins of an old peel tower. i couldget shelter in that old tower, and at the same time slip out of it ifneed be into one of fifty likely hiding places amongst the rocks. i gotinto touch with my cousin jim spurge--the one-eyed chap at the'admiral's arms,' mr. copplestone, that night--and i got in a supply ofmeat and drink, and there i was. and--as things turned out, chatfield hadgot his eye on the very same spot!"

(this was weeks ago) then today i get a fb message and it's him and he tells me he knows and sends me the link of the imgur album.

"that theory's not necessarily correct," replied copplestone. "sircresswell's message may have been quite right. for all we know the folkson the pike had confederates on shore. go carefully, gilling--let's seeif we can make out anything in the way of footprints."

Anyway i get approached by two dudes, an one asked me for a cigarette, his friend had a pouch so i told him no.

Way is a road, route, path or pathway, including long-distance paths.

“that in no possible way could mrs. inglethorp’s death benefit misshoward. now there is no murder without a motive.”

It was only at this point that i finally fell off the shelf, still screaming this high-pitched, i'm-being-murdered wail of sheer terror.

Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought. This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter.  Manslaughter is killing committed in the absence of malice, brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness.

the group separated, and copplestone went off to find the hotel peopleand order an immediate breakfast. and passing along a corridor on his waydownstairs he encountered mrs. greyle, who came out of a room near by andstarted at sight of him.

Background: i just moved into a new apartment, and i'm keeping my cat's litterbox in the bathroom while i train him to use the toilet.

In a building, a room is any space enclosed within a number of walls to which entry is possible only by a door or other dividing structure that connects it either to a passageway, to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it.

a fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the policecourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. ithad been found in mrs. inglethorp’s cheque book, and on being reversedat a mirror, showed clearly the words: “. . . erything of which i diepossessed i leave to my beloved husband alfred ing...” this placedbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour ofthe deceased lady’s husband. japp then produced the charred fragment ofpaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of thebeard in the attic, completed his evidence.

As one of the eldest members of the group surrounded by freshman, i'll admit i was a bit overconfident, walking around, being loud, etc.

"you don't know," said juliet in a voice that trembled ominously. "theyhave found plenty of footmarks. the glasgow detectives said they weresir--sir david southern's. they found his gun too, not cleaned; and theysay he did it, and they have taken him away, to--to prison." a sobescaped her, but she controlled herself with a great effort and went on:"you must prove that he didn't do it. i know he didn't. anyone who knewhim must know he didn't. oh you must, you must, find the real murderer!"

Realizing, he was not inviting me, i was expected to pay.

"and as to that," continued dr. tretheway, "i learnt from mr. greyle thathe had been seriously indisposed for some months before setting out forengland. the voyage had been rather a rough one; he had suffered muchfrom sea-sickness, and, in his state of health, that was unfortunate forhim. i made a careful examination of him, and i came to the conclusionthat he was suffering from a form of myocarditis which was rapidlyassuming a very serious complexion. i earnestly advised him to take asmuch rest as possible, to avoid all unnecessary fatigue and allexcitement, and i strongly deprecated his travelling in one journey tothe north, whither i learnt he was bound. on my advice, he and mr.chatfield decided to break that journey at bristol, at birmingham, and atleeds. by so doing, you see, they would only have a short journey eachday, and mr. greyle would be able to rest for a long time at a stretch.but--i formed my own conclusions."

I tried my very best to wipe the excess shit that had formed in my pants and returned to the meeting.

“don’t be silly!”

 “yes, but she is a good sort, or i am mistaken. she and her brother are the only children of an iron-master somewhere up northumberland way. he got engaged to her when traveling last winter, and she came down to be introduced to his people, with her brother as escort. then came the smash, and she stayed on to nurse her lover, while brother joseph, finding himself pretty snug, stayed on too. i’ve been making a few independent inquiries, you see. but to-day must be a day of inquiries.”

We stayed for another few hours, and my shorts were stained the whole time.

“good heavens!” cried inglethorp, starting up. “what a monstrous idea! i —poison my dearest emily!”

The day was going extremely slow, and i was very bored, so i decided to work on my logo (for a cartoon blog i was starting).

Start can refer to multiple topics: 

widely distributed advertisements also brought to light the nurses of thetwo children; both the nurse who had taken julia out to russia and thewoman who had been with mrs. meredith when she took over the charge ofthe mcconachan baby, quickly claiming the reward that was offered fortheir discovery. there was no longer any room for doubt that juliet byrnewas the same person as juliana mcconachan, or that julia romaninov hadbegun life as little judy harsden.

Edit: for those who are curious/doubting, google "king island lion" and a bunch of stuff comes up.

Doubt is a mental state in which the mind remains suspended between two or more contradictory propositions, unable to be certain of any of them. Doubt on an emotional level is indecision between belief and disbelief. It may involve uncertainty, distrust or lack of conviction on certain facts, actions, motives, or decisions. Doubt can result in delaying or rejecting relevant action out of concern for mistakes or missed opportunities.

 “it is fairly complete in essentials. we know who the author of the revolting business is, although one of the victims still escapes us. of course, you have formed your own conclusions.”

And just my luck, the only charger that i had on me was broken, i had completely forgotten about it.

gimblet walked back to his flat, his mind full of the tragedy which hehad an uneasy feeling he might, in some way, have averted. how, he hardlyknew. lord ashiel could not have lived all his life encircled by a cordonof police and detectives; and, without such precautions, a man condemnedby nihilist societies is practically sure to fall a victim to theirexcellent organization and disregard for the lives of their own members.

It's not hurting (yet), but i start feeling really sick for some reason.

Feeling was originally used to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception. The word is also used to describe other experiences, such as "a feeling of warmth" and of sentience in general. In psychology, the term feeling is closely related to emotion, and usually refers to the conscious subjective experience of emotions. The study of subjective experiences is referred to as phenomenology, whereas psychotherapy refers to a process whereby a therapist helps a client understand their own feelings and experiences. Feelings are also known as a state of consciousness.

 “‘oh! i was expecting you, but you are a trifle before your time. i had a note from my brother this morning in which he sang your praises very loudly.’

My little brother (he was around 8 at the time) came outside and sat with us.

A brother is a man or boy who shares one or more parents with another, a sibling. The female counterpart is a sister. Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships. A full brother is a first degree relative.

"yes," answered dr. mirandolet. "it did. it reminded me of the east--ihave lived in the east--india, burmah, china. it seemed to me that thisman had got hold of some eastern scent, and possibly spilt some on hisclothes. the matter is worth noting. because--i have heard--i cannotsay i have known--of men being poisoned in inhalation."

I still can't believe it happened, and i can't stop blushing out of embarrassment.

A man is an adult male human. Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent).

 i was sufficiently conversant with holmes’s methods to be able to follow his reasoning, and to see that the nature and state of the various medical instruments in the wicker basket which hung in the lamplight inside the brougham had given him the data for his swift deduction. the light in our window above showed that this late visit was indeed intended for us. with some curiosity as to what could have sent a brother medico to us at such an hour, i followed holmes into our sanctum.

Hours later dogs are going crazy and there is an orange glow shining through the windows.

A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof, or vehicle that allows the passage of light and may also allow the passage of sound and sometimes air. Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window. Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. Windows may have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.

 “‘such, in a few words, my dear boy, is the history of this terrible business in which i was involved. next day we were picked up by the brig  hotspur , bound for australia, whose captain found no difficulty in believing that we were the survivors of a passenger ship which had foundered. the transport ship  gloria scott  was set down by the admiralty as being lost at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to her true fate. after an excellent voyage the  hotspur  landed us at sydney, where evans and i changed our names and made our way to the diggings, where, among the crowds who were gathered from all nations, we had no difficulty in losing our former identities.

It was _the_ most embarrassing moment in the _history_ of the human kind.

History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation") is the study of the past. Events before the invention of writing systems are considered prehistory. "History" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events. Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers.History also includes the academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect. Historians  often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians also debate the nature of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of the present.Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends. History differs from myth in that it is supported by evidence. However, ancient cultural influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. History is often taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies.

but before the train from the north was due, zillah was fated to haveyet another experience. she had taken up a position directly beneath apowerful lamp at the end of the arrival platform, so that lauriston,who would be obliged to pass that way, could not fail to see her.suddenly turning, to glance at the clock in the roof behind her, shewas aware of a man, young, tall, athletic, deeply bronzed, as from longcontact with the southern sun, who stood just behind a knot ofloungers, his heavy overcoat and the jacket beneath it thrown open,feeling in his waistcoat pockets as if for his match-box--an unlightedcigar protruded from the corner of his rather grim, determined lips.but it was not at lips, nor at the cigar, nor at the searching fingersthat zillah looked, after that first comprehensive glance--her eyeswent straight to an object which shone in the full glare of the lampabove her head. the man wore an old-fashioned, double-breasted fancywaistcoat, but so low as to reveal a good deal of his shirt-front. andin that space, beneath his bird's-eye blue tie, loosely knotted in abow, zillah saw a stud, which her experienced eyes knew to be ofplatinum, and on it was engraved the same curious device which she hadseen once before that day--on the solitaire exhibited by melky.

I decided to get apple from the top of cabinet, so i hopped on chair, worktop and then stood up on my toes and reached for an apple.

Stade (German pronunciation: [ˈʃtaːdə]), officially the Hanseatic City of Stade (German: Hansestadt Stade, Low German: Hansestadt Stood) is a city in Lower Saxony in northern Germany. First mentioned in records in 934, it is the seat of the district (Landkreis) which bears its name. It is located roughly 45 km (28 mi) to the west of Hamburg and belongs to that city's wider metropolitan region. Within the area of the city are the urban districts of Bützfleth, Hagen, Haddorf and Wiepenkathen, each of which have a council (Ortsrat) of their own with some autonomous decision-making rights.

spurge paused for a minute, and picking out a match from a stand whichstood on the table, began to trace imaginary lines on the mahogany.

I paused and realized what i just said.

a fisherman came lounging across the quay from the shadow of one of theneighbouring cottages. he touched his cap to marston greyle, and lookedinquiringly at the two strangers.

Hopefully, the weather was hot and the windows were open so the smell of rotten eggs escaped quite quickly.

A cap is a flat headgear, usually with a visor. Caps have crowns that fit very close to the head. They made their first appearance as early as 3,200BC. Caps typically have a visor, or no brim at all. They are popular in casual and informal settings, and are seen in sports and fashion.  They are typically designed for warmth, and often incorporate a visor to block sunlight from the eyes. They come in many shapes, sizes, and are of different brands. Baseball caps are one of the most common types of cap.

gimblet was slightly put out at her inference that his plea of businesswas merely an excuse to dismiss her in order that he might go off andplay golf. heaven knew it was no affair of hers whether he played golfthat day or not! but as a matter of fact he had no intention of leavingthe flat that afternoon, and had merely been practising a shot or two onthe carpet after lunch before lord ashiel's arrival. still it was truethat he had made business a pretext for getting rid of her, and this madethe injustice of the widow's further inference ruffle him more than itmight have if she had been entirely in the wrong. he was the mostcourteous of men, and that anyone should suspect him of unnecessaryrudeness distressed him.

If i'm motivated by the threat of hell or the promise of heaven, then i'm not truly moral.

Heaven or the heavens, is a common religious cosmological or transcendent supernatural place where beings such as gods, angels, souls, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or reside. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to Earth or incarnate and earthly beings can ascend to Heaven in the afterlife or, in exceptional cases, enter Heaven alive.

he went over to a writing-table and scribbled a few lines on half-sheetsof notepaper which he enclosed in envelopes and handed to byner.

First she handed one to my father and little sister.

In human biology, handedness is an individual's preferential use of one hand, known as the dominant hand, due to it being stronger, faster or better in dexterity.  The other hand, comparatively often the weaker, less dextrous or simply less subjectively preferred, is called the non-dominant hand. Right-handedness is by far more common; about 90% of the human population are right hand dominant. Handedness is often defined by one's writing hand, as it is fairly common for people to prefer to do some tasks with each hand. There are examples of true ambidexterity (equal preference of either hand), but it is rare — most people prefer using one hand for most purposes.

 “yes, sir. but he was off like a deer after the shot that killed poor william kirwan was fired. mr. cunningham saw him from the bedroom window, and mr. alec cunningham saw him from the back passage. it was quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out. mr. cunningham had just got into bed, and mr. alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing-gown. they both heard william the coachman calling for help, and mr. alec ran down to see what was the matter. the back door was open, and as he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside. one of them fired a shot, the other dropped, and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge. mr. cunningham, looking out of his bedroom, saw the fellow as he gained the road, but lost sight of him at once. mr. alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man, and so the villain got clean away. beyond the fact that he was a middle-sized man and dressed in some dark stuff, we have no personal clue; but we are making energetic inquiries, and if he is a stranger we shall soon find him out.”

Of course, fatty mcquarterpounder's parents showed up about 15 minutes later, and they were out for blood.

A quarter is one-fourth, ¼, 25% or 0.25.

“poor cynthia is quite frightened,” said mrs. cavendish in a low clearvoice. she herself, i noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.then it must be later than i thought. i saw that a faint streak ofdaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that theclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o’clock.

These tomatoes were sitting in a mixture of water and juices so they were quite frozen solid.

there was barely enough to darken the cardboard at the bottom of the box,but he looked at it, before putting on the lid, with an expression ofsome satisfaction.

In the end it results in a shower and just putting the clothes in the laundry.

The golf swing is the action by which players hit the ball in the sport of golf. The golf swing is a complex motion involving the whole body; the technicalities of the swing are known as golf stroke mechanics.

"he was that ill," said the landlord, "that me and my wife never expectedto see him get up that next morning. we wanted them to have a doctor butmr. greyle himself said that it was nothing, but that he had some hearttrouble and that the voyage had made it worse. he said that if he tooksome medicine which he had with him, and a drop of hot brandy-and-water,and got a good night's sleep he'd be all right. and next morning heseemed better, and he got up to breakfast--but my wife said to me that ifshe'd seen death on a man's face it was on his! she's a bit of apersuasive tongue, has my wife, and when she heard that these twogentlemen were thinking of going a long journey--right away to the farnorth, it was, i believe--she got 'em to go and see the doctor first, forshe felt that mr. greyle wasn't fit for the exertion."

The look on her face just dropped and i started wondering what the fuck was going on.

“if you mean that i was fond of her—yes, i was. you know, emily was aselfish old woman in her way. she was very generous, but she alwayswanted a return. she never let people forget what she had done forthem—and, that way she missed love. don’t think she ever realized it,though, or felt the lack of it. hope not, anyway. i was on a differentfooting. i took my stand from the first. ‘so many pounds a year i’mworth to you. well and good. but not a penny piece besides—not a pairof gloves, nor a theatre ticket.’ she didn’t understand—was veryoffended sometimes. said i was foolishly proud. it wasn’t that—but icouldn’t explain. anyway, i kept my self-respect. and so, out of thewhole bunch, i was the only one who could allow myself to be fond ofher. i watched over her. i guarded her from the lot of them, and then aglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotiongo for nothing.”

but by the end of the week hope was dropping to zero again withlauriston. no letters had arrived--either from john purdie or theeditor. on the sunday morning he was again face to face with the lasthalf-crown. he laid out his money very cautiously that day, but when hehad paid for a frugal dinner at a cheap coffee-shop, he had only ashilling left. he wandered into kensington gardens that sundayafternoon, wondering what he had best do next. and as he stood by therailings of the ornamental water, watching the water-fowls' doings,somebody bade him good-day, and he turned to find the pretty girl ofthe pawnshop standing at his side and smiling shyly at him.

He smelled me and the look of surprise on his face couldn't be replicated by the greatest actor in the world.

The face is the front of an animal's head that features three of the head's sense organs, the eyes, nose, and mouth, and through which animals express many of their emotions. The face is crucial for human identity, and damage such as scarring or developmental deformities affects the psyche adversely.

for this was the man, who, in a few years, had unravelled more apparentlyinsoluble mysteries, and caused the arrest of more hitherto evasivescoundrels, than his predecessors had managed to secure in a decade. thename of gimblet was known and detested wherever a coiner carried on hisforbidden craft, or a blackmailer concocted his cowardly plans; burglarsand forgers cursed freely when he was mentioned, and there was hardly anillicit trade in the country which had not suffered at one time oranother from his inquisitive habit of interesting himself in otherpeople's affairs. scotland yard officials were never too proud to callupon him for help, and many a difficulty he had helped them out of,though he refused an offer of a regular post in the criminalinvestigation department, preferring to be at liberty to choose whatcases he would take up. above all things he loved the strange andinexplicable. gimblet had not always been a detective. indeed, he oftensmiled to himself when he thought of the extraordinary confidence whichthe public now elected to repose in him.

My town has ~20,000 inhabitants so everyone knows everyone and the new team shared the same gym as my old team.

A habit (or wont as a humorous and formal term) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.The American Journal of Psychology (1903) defined a "habit, from the standpoint of psychology, [as] a more or less fixed  way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience." Habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when undertaking routine tasks. Habits are sometimes compulsory. A 2002 daily experience study by habit researcher Wendy Wood and her colleagues found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns which humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency; lack of awareness; unintentionality; and uncontrollability.

"the next thing i remember was looking up into the anxious friendly faceof andrew campbell, one of the ghillies at inverashiel. it seemed to behanging above me in the sky, which was the only other thing i could see,and i wondered vaguely why i saw it upside down. my head was achingcruelly and i couldn't imagine what was the matter, though i was too weakand faint to care. to cut my adventure short, andrew had come to a poollower down the river just as i floated into it on top of the current; hehad fished me out, and was now restoring me to life again. i was got backto the house, how i hardly know, put to bed, and actually wept over bylord ashiel. by the evening i had so far recovered that i was able tocome down to dinner, though i should not have done so if it had not beenfor the anxiety of my host, as my head still felt as if it was going tosplit. i received many congratulations on my escape, and lord ashiel,when he spoke of it, was so much moved that every one was quiteembarrassed, and i myself was touched beyond expression at the affectionhe did not attempt to conceal. he was very silent after that, but inspite of him dinner that night was a merry meal. every one was in thebest of spirits, or else assumed them for the time being. we all jokedand laughed over my adventure, and mr. mcconachan said i bore a charmedlife, since i had escaped being killed by his careless shot, and now theriver refused to drown me. it was not till the servants had left theroom, and we were preparing to do the same, that lord ashiel spoke again.

As i looked into his ever filling food supply, i wondered when he would come for me.

Wonder is an emotion comparable to surprise that people feel when perceiving something rare or unexpected (but not threatening). It has historically been seen as an important aspect of human nature, specifically being linked with curiosity and the drive behind intellectual exploration. Wonder is also often compared to the emotion of awe but awe implies fear or respect rather than joy.

then poirot repeated the question he had put to dorcas:

With those few seconds i had, i placed the little guy on the lap and covered it with the question paper.

A question is an utterance which typically functions as a request for information, which is expected to be provided in the form of an answer. Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered.

ayscough's glance wandered from the rings to a table which stood, alittle to one side, in the middle of the parlour. lauriston turned inthat direction, also. two objects immediately met his eye. on the tablestood a small tray, full of rings--not dissimilar in style andappearance to those which he held in his hand: old-fashioned rings. thelight from the gas-brackets above the mantel-piece caught the facets ofthe diamonds in those rings and made little points of fire; here andthere he saw the shimmer of pearls. but there was another object. closeby the tray of old rings lay a book--a beautifully bound book, a smallquarto in size, with much elaborate gold ornament on the back and side,and gilt clasps holding the heavy leather binding together. it lookedas if some hand had recently thrown this book carelessly on the table.

The bike goes flying from my hands and i'm nearly horizontal by this point.

A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each "hand" and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having "hands" instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described as having "hands" though opposable thumbs are lacking.Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally — for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.The human hand usually has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers. It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone, the number of which varies among people, 14 of which are the phalanges (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers and thumb. The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist. Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.

hours passed, and darkness fell upon the world without. in the patch ofloch that was visible to her, she could see a star mirrored; it cheeredher somehow. what there was comforting about it she could not have said,but in some way it seemed to be an emblem of her hopes. she wedgedherself tightly between the roots, laid her head down upon the uppermostof them, and, such is the adaptability of youth and health, slept on herdangerous perch like a bird upon a bough.

Recently i have had some less than pleasant reactions to spicy stuff, as do many people in the world of ethnic food.

In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a "plurality of worlds". Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as "[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be". Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the "horizon of all horizons". In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent. In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world.

“miss howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the dayof my friend’s arrival here? he repeated it to me, and there is asentence of yours that has impressed me very much. do you rememberaffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved hadbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who thecriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?”

I still remember the surprised look in her eyes vividly etched in my mind.

“i should consider it very unlikely. strychnine is not used fordomestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictionsplaced on its sale.”

During that visit i thought she said a few thing that sounded as if she turned a new leaf and might consider relocating if we were to be married.

collingwood went away to his chambers. he was much occupied just then,and had little time to think of anything but the work in hand. but as heate his lunch at the club which he had joined on settling in barford, hetried to get at some notion of the state of things, and once more hismind reverted to the time of his grandfather's death, and his ownsuspicions about pratt at that period. clearly that was a point to whichthey must hark back--he himself must make more inquiries about thecircumstances of antony bartle's last hours. for this affair would nothave to rest where it was--it was intolerable that nesta mallathorpeshould in any way be under pratt's power. he went back to eldrick atfour o'clock with a suggestion or two in his mind. and at the sight ofhim eldrick shook his head.

Then i went online and checked the news stations' twitter feeds.

Went can mean:

“they were, of course, an accusation against her husband.”

Then the swearing started, and accusations started flying.

An accusation is a statement by one person asserting that another person or entity has done something improper. The person who makes the accusation is an accuser, while the subject against whom it is made is the accused. Whether a statement is interpreted as an accusation relies on the social environment in which it is made:

as quietly and composedly as if he were discharging the most ordinary ofhis daily duties, pratt unfolded the document, and went close to thesolitary gas jet above eldrick's desk. what he held in his hand was ahalf-sheet of ruled foolscap paper, closely covered with writing, whichhe at once recognized as that of the late john mallathorpe. he wasfamiliar with that writing--he had often seen it. it was anold-fashioned writing--clear, distinct, with every letter well and fullyformed.

On the way home, i had to stop at a gas station to avoid urinating on myself, then running out of gas.

Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma).A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture, such as air, contains a variety of pure gases. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer.

"your honour mustn't go in force at all!" he said. "what's wanted,gentlemen, is--strategy! now if you'll let me put it to you, me knowingthe lie of the land, this is what had ought to be done. a small partyought to go--with me to lead. we'll follow the road that cuts across themoorland to a certain point; then we'll take a by-track that gets you tohigh nick; there we'll take to a thick bit o' wood and coppice that runsright up to the peel tower. nobody'll track us, nor see us from anypoint, going that way. three or four of us--these here young gentlemen,now, and me--'ll be enough for the job--if armed. a revolver apiece yourhonour--that'll be plenty. and as for the rest--what you might call areserve force--your honour said something just now about some warrants.is the police to be in at it, then?"

Having sex on camera was something i thought will be fun to do just once and get paid a lot of money.

the landlord nodded his head--and then shook it in a manner which seemedto indicate that while he agreed with this proposition in one respect heentertained some sort of doubt about it in others.

I don't doubt that i made her uncomfortable but to call drunken flirting sexual harassment at a party where everyone is drinking.

Doubt is a mental state in which the mind remains suspended between two or more contradictory propositions, unable to be certain of any of them. Doubt on an emotional level is indecision between belief and disbelief. It may involve uncertainty, distrust or lack of conviction on certain facts, actions, motives, or decisions. Doubt can result in delaying or rejecting relevant action out of concern for mistakes or missed opportunities.

"best place on this coast--seashore and inland," said spurge. "and as youtwo london gentlemen doesn't know it, i'll tell you about it. if you wasto go out o' scarhaven harbour and turn north, you'd sail along our coastline up here to the mouth of norcaster bay and you'd think there wasnever an inlet between 'em. but there is. about half-way betweenscarhaven and norcaster there's a very narrow opening in the cliffs thatyou'd never notice unless you were close in shore, and inside thatopening there's a cove that's big enough to take a thousand-tonvessel--aye, and half-a-dozen of 'em! it was a favourite place forsmugglers in the old days, and they call it darkman's dene to this day inmemory of a famous old smuggler that used it a good deal. well, now, atthe land end of that cove there's a narrow valley that runs up to themoorland and the hills, full o' rocks and crags and precipices and suchlike--something o' the same sort as hobkin's hole but a deal wilder, andthat's known as the reaver's glen, because in other days thecattle-lifters used to bring their stolen goods, cattle and sheep, downthere where they could pen 'em in, as it were. there's piles o' places inthat glen where a man can hide--i picked out one right at the top, at theedge of the moors, where there's the ruins of an old peel tower. i couldget shelter in that old tower, and at the same time slip out of it ifneed be into one of fifty likely hiding places amongst the rocks. i gotinto touch with my cousin jim spurge--the one-eyed chap at the'admiral's arms,' mr. copplestone, that night--and i got in a supply ofmeat and drink, and there i was. and--as things turned out, chatfield hadgot his eye on the very same spot!"

I can deal with teeny kids like a pro, and generally get along with cousins and friend's younger siblings/etc.

Commonly, "cousin" refers to a "first cousin", a relative whose most recent common ancestor with the subject is a grandparent. More generally, in the lineal kinship system used in the English-speaking world, a cousin is a type of familial relationship in which two relatives are two or more familial generations away from their most recent common ancestor.

"not till our people and the police-surgeon have seen him," answeredayscough, shaking his head. "i want to know all about this--he may havedied a natural death--a seizure of some sort--and again, hemayn't--they'll be here in a minute."

I'm having a hard time finishing this because i'm

john looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of thiscryptic saying. he handed the two keys which dr. bauerstein had givenhim to me.

By no fault other than his own lack of understanding of of dating terminology.

Understanding is a psychological process related to an abstract or physical object, such as a person, situation, or message whereby one is able to use concepts to model that object.

mrs. mallathorpe took another searching look at her visitor. pratt wasleaning over the corner of the desk, towards her; already he had loweredhis tones to the mysterious and confidential note.

Filling out forms was an overwhelming challenge that took hours.

Took is a variant of the English surname Tooke, originally found predominantly in the East Anglia region of the United Kingdom. 

then had come the swift physical disaster from which she had barelyescaped with her life. she had not had time to recover from this when, afew hours later, she had been called upon to face the emotions andagitations aroused by the news of her relationship to lord ashiel, andthe history of her birth and parentage. in the midst of this excitementhad come the sudden tragedy of which she had been a witness, and whichhad overwhelmed and prostrated her with grief and horror. next day shehad been obliged to undergo the ordeal of being cross-questioned by thepolice, and close upon that had come the final catastrophe of david'sarrest and departure. this last shock so overshadowed all the rest of hermisfortunes that it stimulated her to action, and she had herself runmost of the way to the post office two miles down the road, to send thetelegram of appeal to gimblet.

I waited like 15 seconds to see if he'd come back but he was doing kid shit so i got up from what i was doing and went to close the door.

he drew one of his cards from his pocket and carrying it into thebooking office exchanged a few words with the clerk at the window.presently he rejoined melky. "he took a ticket for whitechapel,"remarked ayscough as he strolled quietly up. "ah! now what does a youngjapanese medical student want going down that way at eleven o'clock atnight? something special, no doubt, mr. rubinstein. however, i'm goingwestward just now. just going to have a look in at the great westernhotel, to see if mr. purdie heard anything from that american chap--andthen i'm for home and bed. like to come to the hotel with me?"

So i have the bright idea to go to the front desk and ask the sweet old clerk if the restroom had lights.

A clerk ( or ) is a white-collar worker who conducts general office tasks, or a worker who performs similar sales-related tasks in a retail environment. The responsibilities of clerical workers commonly include record keeping, filing, staffing service counters, screening callers, and other administrative tasks.

before answering each question he ran over it aloud, and discussed it.how long had he known mr. alfred beckwith?  that he had to calculate byyears upon his fingers.  what were his habits?  no difficulty about them;temperate in the last degree, and took a little too much exercise, ifanything.  all the answers were satisfactory.  when he had written themall, he looked them over, and finally signed them in a very pretty hand.he supposed he had now done with the business.  i told him he was notlikely to be troubled any farther.  should he leave the papers there? ifhe pleased.  much obliged.  good-morning.

We're both very open and brutally frank with people, and it works for our relationship.

"but that's just the tiresome part," she returned, "i should like you toknow everything, and yet i must not let you know. she is not mine, ofcourse, but beyond that her parentage must remain a secret, even fromyou. yet this i may say: she is the child of a friend of mine, and thereis no scandal attached to her birth, but i have taken all responsibilityas to her future. are you, arthur, also prepared to adopt her?"

Got that taken care of, got back to my room, changed, threw my stuff in a bag, then went for a late breakfast.

there was no time for more. miss howard was swallowed up in an eagerchorus of protests and good-byes. the inglethorps did not appear.

I decided this morning to listen to the imagine dragons interview on the howard stern show.

Howard is an English-language given name originating from Old French Huard (or Houard) from a Germanic source similar to Old High German *Hugihard "heart-brave", or *Hoh-ward, literally "high defender; chief guardian". It is also probably in some cases a confusion with the Old Norse cognate Haward (Hávarðr), which means "high guard" and as a surname also with the unrelated Hayward. In some rare cases it is from the Old English eowu hierde "ewe herd". In Anglo-Norman the French digramm -ou- was often rendered as -ow- such as tour → tower, flour (western variant form of fleur) → flower, etc. (with svarabakhti). A diminutive is "Howie" and its shortened form is "Ward" (most common in the 19th century). Between 1900 and 1960, Howard ranked in the U.S. Top 200; between 1960 and 1990, it ranked in the U.S. Top 400; between 1990 and 2004, it ranked in the U.S. Top 600.  People with the given name Howard or its variants include:

the nearest to him, a tall woman of ample proportions, was visiblyaffected by the ceremony she had just witnessed, and dabbed from time totime at her eyes with a handkerchief.

I start congratulating myself mentally.

Tall commonly refers to:

 “if not, there is no harm done. but if mr. phelps is correct in stating that there is no hiding-place either in the room or the corridors, then the person must have come from outside. if he came from outside on so wet a night, and yet left no trace of damp upon the linoleum, which was examined within a few minutes of his passing, then it is exceeding probable that he came in a cab. yes, i think that we may safely deduce a cab.”

We had a fun time demonstrating our thermite reaction and igniters (outside safely), and all in all a fun summer.

Safety is the state of being "safe", the condition of being protected from harm or other danger. Safety can also refer to the control of recognized hazards in order to achieve an acceptable level of risk.

“i will ask you nothing. it is enough for me that it is as i thought.and i—i, too, have an instinct. we are working together towards acommon end.”

As i was working in the kitchen preparing for opening, in about 4 hours i started to feel nauseated.

"there they are!" he said triumphantly. "been in my possession eversince--and will remain there. now--do you wish to read the letter? i'veread it to you word for word. you don't? very good--back it goes inthere, with these keys. and now then," he continued, having replacedletter and keys in his drawer, and turned to her again, "now then, yousee what a diabolical scheme it was that was in your mother's mindagainst me. she meant me to meet with the fate which overtook her ownson! she meant me to fall through that bridge. why? she hoped that ishould break my neck--as he did! she wanted to silence me--but she alsowanted more--she wanted to take from my dead body, or my unconsciousbody, the certain something which she was so anxious i should bring withme, which she referred to as  that document . she was willing to riskanything--even to murder!--to get hold of that. and now you know why iwent to normandale grange that saturday--you know, now, the real reason.i told a deliberate lie at the inquest, for your mother's sake--for yoursake, if you know it. i did not go there to hand in my application forthe stewardship--i went in response to the letter i've just read. is allthis clear to you?"

At a certain point during that year i have developed a habit of smoking a cigarette and having some jack daniels on my porch.

Certainty (also known as epistemic certainty or objective certainty) is the epistemic property of beliefs which a person has no rational grounds for doubting. One standard way of defining epistemic certainty is that a belief is certain if and only if the person holding that belief could not be mistaken in holding that belief. Other common definitions of certainty involve the indubitable nature of such beliefs or define certainty as a property of those beliefs with the greatest possible justification. Certainty is closely related to knowledge, although contemporary philosophers tend to treat knowledge as having lower requirements than certainty.Importantly, epistemic certainty is not the same thing as psychological certainty (also known as subjective certainty or certitude), which describes the highest degree to which a person could be convinced that something is true. While a person may be completely convinced that a particular belief is true, and might even be psychologically incapable of entertaining its falsity, this does not entail that the belief is itself beyond rational doubt or incapable of being false. While the word "certainty" is sometimes used to refer to a person's subjective certainty about the truth of a belief, philosophers are primarily interested in the question of whether any beliefs ever attain objective certainty. 

he was half tempted to go round to the cottage and show the queer scrawlto audrey greyle, of whom, having passed six delightful hours in hercompany--he was beginning to think much more than was good for him,unless he intended to begin thinking of her always. but he was stillyoung enough to have a spice of bashfulness about him, and he did notwant to seem too pushing or forward. again, it seemed to him that theanonymous letter conveyed, in some subtle fashion, a hint that it was tobe regarded as sacred and secret, and copplestone had a strong sense ofhonour. he knew that mrs. wooler was femininely curious to hear all aboutthat letter, but he took care not to mention it to her. instead hequietly consulted an ordnance map of the district which hung framed andglazed in the hall of the inn, and discovering that hobkin's hole wasmarked on it as being something or other a mile or two out of scarhavenon the inland side, he set out in its direction next morning afterbreakfast, without a word to anyone as to where he was going. and that hemight not be entirely defenceless he carried peter chatfield's oakenstaff with him--that would certainly serve to crack any ordinary skull,if need arose for measure of defence.

Boom, error after error in the test, and memtest actually crashed half way through it.

One half is the irreducible fraction resulting from dividing one by two (2) or the fraction resulting from dividing any number by its double. Multiplication by one half is equivalent to division by two, or "halving"; conversely, division by one half is equivalent to multiplication by two, or "doubling". One half often appears in mathematical equations, recipes, measurements, etc. Half can also be said to be one part of something divided into two equal parts.

“enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists andstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! but there’sworse than that.”

I live in a fraternity in germany, which means parties can get a little excessive if u know what i mean.

A man is an adult male human. Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent).

he laid a dirty, crumpled half-sheet of cheap note-paper on the table atwhich they were all sitting, and copplestone, bending over it, read aloudwhat was there written.

We don't have a dining room table in our house, so i usually eat sitting on the floor at our coffee table.

the coroner handed him the register in which his signature wasinscribed.

I figured it was a petition because there were various signatures.

A signature (; from Latin: signare, "to sign") is a handwritten (and often stylized) depiction of someone's name, nickname, or even a simple "X" or other mark that a person writes on documents as a proof of identity and intent. The writer of a signature is a signatory or signer. Similar to a handwritten signature, a signature work describes the work as readily identifying its creator. A signature may be confused with an autograph, which is chiefly an artistic signature. This can lead to confusion when people have both an autograph and signature and as such some people in the public eye keep their signatures private whilst fully publishing their autograph.

he was a tall, fair man, evidently a foreigner, but with nothing verystriking about his appearance. a pointed yellow beard hid the lower partof his face, and, for the rest, his nose was short, his eyes blue andclose together, and his forehead high and narrow. he looked closely atgimblet as he went by, and for a moment the eyes of the two men met, bothequally inscrutable and unflinching; then the stranger glanced aside andstrode on to where a small boat lay moored. the detective turned his backwhile the fair man got in and pushed off into the loch.

The straw pushed the 'scoop' of soft-serve to the bottom of the cup.

“but i did, my friend. several hints. you would not take them. thinknow, did i ever say to you that i believed john cavendish guilty? did inot, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly beacquitted?”

It certainly helped but the sauce was still burning, i was sweating, my eyes were glazing over and now i was bloated from the milk.

there was abundant cover for zachary spurge and for half-a-dozen like himin the village school-house when the inquest was opened at ten o'clockthat morning. it seemed to copplestone that it would have been a physicalimpossibility to crowd more people within the walls than had assembledwhen the coroner, a local solicitor, who was obviously testy, irritable,self-important and afflicted with deafness, took his seat and lookedsourly on the crowd of faces. copplestone had already seen him inconversation with the village doctor, the village police, chatfield, andmarston greyle's solicitor, and he began to see the force of spurge'sshrewd remarks. what, of course, was most desired was secrecy andprivacy--the scarhaven powers had no wish that the attention of all theworld should be drawn to this quiet place. but outsiders were there inplenty. stafford and several members of bassett oliver's company hadmotored over from norcaster and had succeeded in getting good places:there were half-a-dozen reporters from norcaster and northborough, andplain-clothes police from both towns. and there, too, were all theprincipal folk of the neighbourhood, and mrs. greyle and her daughter,and, a little distance from audrey, alert and keenly interested, wasaddie chatfield.

After a bit of trying i succeeded.

while lady ruth carried juliet off at once to the cottage, there to becomforted, fed, made much of and put to bed, gimblet and the men who hadassisted him in the work of rescue stayed behind in the walls of thetower, to rig up, with ropes and buckets, an apparatus by which todescend to that lowest depth of the  oubliette  where poor julia's bodymust be lying.

So i would plug in my curling iron under my desk when the boss wasn't around and use my reflection in one of my cubical walls to touch up my ends.

"ah!" said gilling. "that's interesting. now i wonder if you found out ifhe was well up in the family history?"

So im standing there like god damn; not worth arguing so just said 'you bet wont happen again.

Saʽid (Arabic: سعيد‎ Saʽīd), also spelled Saʽeid, Said, Saïd, Sid, Saeed or Sayid, is a male Arabic given name which means "blessed (in Quranic Classical Arabic), good luck, joy" or "happy, patient". The name stems from the Arabic verb sa‘ada (سَعَدَ - 'to be happy, fortunate or lucky').

"that's about it, sir," answered the door-keeper. he had taken down asort of ledger as the manager spoke, and was now turning over its leaves.he suddenly ran his finger down a page and stopped its course at aparticular line.

I stopped singing and playing and gave the drummer a " *dude.

"she shall not," mark stammered furiously. he seemed to be halfsuffocating with rage. "she shall not go unless she swears to saynothing. swear it, i say!"

Before long, i met a girl who shall hereon be referred to as yaoyao.

Shall and will are two of the English modal verbs. They have various uses, including the expression of propositions about the future, in what is usually referred to as the future tense of English.

"why," she said, shaking her head wonderingly, "that i'm absolutelycertain that my mother never even knew this man pratt--i don't i thinkshe even knew his name--until quite recently. i know when she got toknow him, too. it was just about the time that you first called here--atthe time of mr. bartle's death. our butler told me this morning thatpratt came here late one evening--just about that time!--and asked tosee my mother, and was with her for some time in the study. oh! what isit all about?--and why doesn't she tell me?"

The sensation was like nothing else, being that of pain and unknowing what just happened.

Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts (descriptive knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). By most accounts, knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many sources, including but not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry, education, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology.

 but i waited for none of the landlord’s explanations. in a tingle of fear i was already running down the village street, and making for the path which i had so lately descended. it had taken me an hour to come down. for all my efforts two more had passed before i found myself at the fall of reichenbach once more. there was holmes’s alpine-stock still leaning against the rock by which i had left him. but there was no sign of him, and it was in vain that i shouted. my only answer was my own voice reverberating in a rolling echo from the cliffs around me.

I've been too unlucky lately.

“then you’ll write to the princess after tea, alfred? i’ll write tolady tadminster for the second day, myself. or shall we wait until wehear from the princess? in case of a refusal, lady tadminster mightopen it the first day, and mrs. crosbie the second. then there’s theduchess—about the school fête.”

So at my high school, we have this program called the global studies program.

A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university.

‘slinkton is not come yet,’ said this creature, staggering up when i wentin; ‘i’ll call him.—halloa!  julius cæsar!  come and drink!’  as hehoarsely roared this out, he beat the poker and tongs together in a madway, as if that were his usual manner of summoning his associate.

Here we come orlando! 

so i wish i went through her phone after we got done with the vacation.

"you haven't told me, dear," he said, "what you are doing here."

Until a security guard came at us 

what are you doing here? who let you up here?
"um, our tickets said 10am, so we thought we should be on time.

"that's mine," said the inquiry agent. "i left word at the hotel thatthey were to send to your chambers if any wire came for me. allow me."he opened the telegram, looked it over, and waiting until the clerk hadgone, turned to his companions. "here's a message from my partner, mr.halstead," he continued. "listen to what he wires:

My mind went haywire, imagining serial killer crime scenes and neighborhood rapists.

A wire is a single usually cylindrical, flexible strand or rod of metal. Wires are used to bear mechanical loads or electricity and telecommunications signals. Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate. Wire gauges come in various standard sizes, as expressed in terms of a gauge number. The term 'wire' is also used more loosely to refer to a bundle of such strands, as in "multistranded wire", which is more correctly termed a wire rope in mechanics, or a cable in electricity.

"strong grounds!" replied the detective, "and equally strong ones forbelieving the man came there by foul play, too."

I got the strongest boner i have ever felt in my life and said i have to go to the bathroom.

byner nodded and turned to the landlord.

I saw him a few times after the fuck up and he never even nodded in my direction.

the following morning, mrs. inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, asshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about12.30, and swept lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.

So i've always had eczema and my nails were getting dirty from scratching my knuckles so i rubbed it against the velcro inside a bag.

A bed is a piece of furniture which is used as a place to sleep, rest, and relax.Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned mattress on a bed frame. The mattress rests either on a solid base, often wood slats, or a sprung base. Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base, which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs, to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two people. While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the murphy bed, which folds into a wall, the sofa bed, which folds out of a sofa, and the bunk bed, which provides two mattresses on two tiers as well as a ladder to access the upper tier. Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot. Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the hammock. Other beds are made specifically for animals.

 “it is fairly complete in essentials. we know who the author of the revolting business is, although one of the victims still escapes us. of course, you have formed your own conclusions.”

I quickly performed damage control, realized there was no fire and set about to clear the smoke and get the alarms to stop screaming at me.

"sent off, do you see, sir, twenty minutes ago," observed the butler,pointing to some figures in the telegram form. "so--mr. levendale musthave been close by--then!"

I plugged it in and observed the machine work for a few moments before turning it off again to get situated onto it.

Observation is the active acquisition of information from a primary source. In living beings, observation employs the senses. In science, observation can also involve the perception and recording of data via the use of scientific instruments. The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity. Observations can be qualitative, that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or quantitative if a numerical value is attached to the observed phenomenon by counting or measuring.

stafford and copplestone presently found themselves travelling back alongthe main line. a run of twenty minutes brought them to the junction,where, at an adjacent siding they found a sort of train in miniaturewhich ran over a narrow-gauge railway towards the sea. its course laythrough a romantic valley hidden between high heather-clad moorland; theysaw nothing of their destination nor of the coast until, coming to a stopin a little station perched high on the side of a hill they emerged tosee shore and sea lying far beneath them. with a mutual consent theypassed outside the grey walls of the station-yard to take a comprehensiveview of the scene.

We all freaked the fuck out and scrambled into the corner as far away from it as possible.

"there was his poor lordship lying forward on the table, his head on theblotting-book, and one arm hanging down beside him. quite dead, he was,sir, and his blood all on the floor, poor gentleman. we left him as wefound him, and went back.

I crawled out and convinced them that i went to sleep the other way, and must have turned around while i was asleep.

Went can mean:

i had never been in those chambers before.  they were dismal, close,unwholesome, and oppressive; the furniture, originally good, and not yetold, was faded and dirty,—the rooms were in great disorder; there was astrong prevailing smell of opium, brandy, and tobacco; the grate andfire-irons were splashed all over with unsightly blotches of rust; and ona sofa by the fire, in the room where breakfast had been prepared, laythe host, mr. beckwith, a man with all the appearances of the worst kindof drunkard, very far advanced upon his shameful way to death.

Bearing in mind i'm in no way attractive, and i don't even like myself, so i never would have thought there'd be a chance of someone liking  me.

Way is a road, route, path or pathway, including long-distance paths.

"there is them about as wouldn't be slow to say as much," answered thelandlord. "folks will talk! you see, sir--nobody saw what happened. andwhen country folk doesn't see what takes place, with their own eyes,then they----"

The funeral home we went to was one that was close to the old folks home in sioux city, and the air was kind of.

"i haven't the remotest notion of what you're talking about, you know,"said purdie good-naturedly. "you evidently know more than i do. i knewandie lauriston well enough up to the time he left peebles, but i'venever seen or heard of him since until he wrote to me the other week.what's it all about, and why has he gone back to peebles? i told him iwas coming up here any day now--and here i am, and he's gone!"

When i walk in there he is standing welcoming everyone into the class.

i had been turning over an idea in my head, and i felt that the momenthad now come to broach it. yet i was a little chary of doing so. john,i knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoingoptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. it might bedifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. lawrence, on theother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, ifelt i might count upon as an ally. there was no doubt that the momenthad come for me to take the lead.

Ironically i've been better at turning the homework in more often, but this second test.

Turning is a machining process in which a cutting tool, typically a non-rotary tool bit, describes a helix toolpath by moving more or less linearly while the workpiece rotates.

 “my god! are you in the police yourself?”

I sit outside in handcuffs with the police.

The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state, with the aim to enforce the law, to ensure the safety, health and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder. Their lawful powers include arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence. The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes.

i myself had been given a job at the war office, so was able to seethem continually.

Fast forward to today.

War is an intense armed conflict between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and militias. It is generally characterized by extreme violence, aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties. 

"dear me," said gimblet. "i don't know why i thought he was rather by wayof being a connoisseur. well, well, i mustn't waste any more time. iwanted to ask you if you would mind my going all over the house. i maysee something suggestive. who knows? at present i have only examined thelibrary and your uncle's bedroom."

With a very naïve "don't worry i know how to do this" i yanked the towel, pulling my knee back, the opposite way to where it was popped out.

naturally it was very annoying for the cavendishes. the house wasconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently deniedadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,where they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of thehousehold. we all lived in a blast of publicity. the scotland yard mencame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved oftongue. towards what end they were working, we did not know. had theyany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category ofundiscovered crimes?

"this is the last will of me, john mallathorpe, of normandale grange, inthe parish of normandale, in the west riding of the county of york. iappoint martin william charlesworth, manufacturer, of holly lodge,barford, and arthur james wyatt, chartered accountant, of 65, beckstreet, barford, executors and trustees of this my will. i give anddevise all my estate and effects real and personal of which i may diepossessed or entitled to unto the said martin william charlesworth andarthur james wyatt upon trust for the following purposes to be carriedout by them under the following instructions, namely:--as soon after mydeath as is conveniently possible they will sell all my real estate,either by private treaty or by public auction; they shall sell all mypersonal property of any nature whatsoever; they shall sell my businessat mallathorpe's mill in barford as a going concern to any privatepurchaser or to any company already in existence or formed for thepurpose of acquiring it; and they shall collect all debts and moneys dueto me. and having sold and disposed of all my property, real andpersonal, and brought all the proceeds of such sales and of suchcollection of debts and moneys into one common fund they shall first payall debts owing by me and all legal duties and expenses arising out ofmy death and this disposition of my property and shall then distributemy estate as follows, namely: to each of themselves, martin williamcharlesworth and arthur james wyatt, they shall pay the sum of fivethousand pounds; to my sister-in-law, ann mallathorpe, they shall paythe sum of ten thousand pounds; to my nephew, harper john mallathorpe,they shall pay the sum of ten thousand pounds; to my niece, nestamallathorpe, they shall pay the sum of ten thousand pounds. and as tothe whole of the remaining residue they shall pay it in one sum to themayor and corporation of the borough of barford in the county of york tobe applied by the said mayor and corporation at their own absolutediscretion and in any manner which seems good to them to theestablishment, furtherance and development of technical and commercialeducation in the said borough of barford. dated this sixteenth day ofnovember, 1906.

The band i joined up with has been doing really well this last summer.

"this discovery, of course, made us aware that we were now face to facewith a new development. we were not long in arriving at a conclusionabout that. chang li had found out that his friend had become possessedof these valuable--he might have discovered the matter of the diamond,or of the bank-notes or both--how was immaterial. but we wereconvinced, putting everything together, that he had made thisdiscovery, had probably laid in wait for chen li as he returned homethat night, had run a knife into him as he went up the garden, haddragged the body into the shrubbery, possessed himself of the loot, andmade off. and now we were face to face with what was going, as we knew,to be the stiffest part of our work--the finding of chang li. we set towork on that without a moment's delay.

So i stuffed it in there *along with everything else that required cold water* and left to do other stuff.

“i think, mr. cavendish,” said poirot gravely, “that you would do wellnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. can you tell me the viewsof the other members of the family?”

Once the water was off, the sound of rushing water went away, which gave me the false sense that my problem had been solved.

 “but very superficial,” said holmes. “we come now, however, to a point which is of importance. you may not be aware that the deduction of a man’s age from his writing is one which has been brought to considerable accuracy by experts. in normal cases one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence. i say normal cases, because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the signs of old age, even when the invalid is a youth. in this case, looking at the bold, strong hand of the one, and the rather broken-backed appearance of the other, which still retains its legibility although the t’s have begun to lose their crossing, we can say that the one was a young man and the other was advanced in years without being positively decrepit.”

You know what she does to say thank you.

a strangled cry from the bed startled me. a fresh access of pain seizedthe unfortunate old lady. the convulsions were of a violence terribleto behold. everything was confusion. we thronged round her, powerlessto help or alleviate. a final convulsion lifted her from the bed, untilshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body archedin an extraordinary manner. in vain mary and john tried to administermore brandy. the moments flew. again the body arched itself in thatpeculiar fashion.

I repeated the process of digging around in my burning eye socket until i finally got my contact out and flushed my left eye with water.

to a mournful dirge on the pipes, ashiel was laid in his rocky grave, andthe throng of black-garmented people was ferried back the way it hadcome. gimblet, wrapped to the ears in a thick overcoat, and with a silkscarf wound high round his neck, shivered in the cold air, for the windhad veered to the north, and the first breath of the arctic winter wasalready carried on it. the waters of the loch had turned a slaty black;little angry waves broke incessantly over its surface; and inky blackclouds were gathering slowly on the distant horizon. it looked as if thefine weather were at an end; as if nature herself were mourning angrilyat the wanton destruction of her child. the pity and regret gimblet hadfelt, as he stood by the murdered man's grave, suddenly turned to afeeling of rage, both with himself and with the victim of the crime.

Relief quickly turned to embarrassment and i hastily left no doubt adding another story to the doctors wtf list.

"and yet, in spite of reason, i could not help feeling that the societyof the friends of man must be at the bottom of the whole thing in someway i had not yet fathomed. i made every inquiry as to whether anyforeigner had visited the castle or been seen in the neighbourhood, butthe only strangers among the visitors had been miss julia romaninov andmiss juliet byrne's french maid, both of whose alibis appeared so farunimpeachable. i had it on lady ruth's authority that miss romaninov hadbeen in the drawing-room with the other ladies at the time of the murder,and all the servants were at supper in the servants' hall. otherwise ishould have been inclined to look on julia romaninov with a suspiciouseye, as being the only russian i knew to be on the spot. the last wordthe dying man had been able to pronounce, too, was, according to missbyrne, 'steps' which might very well have been intended for steppes, andhave some connection with the enemies he dreaded.

I always wanted to drive a luxury vehicle, so i had the mindset of getting one if they had one available.

“was not that—pardon the question, mr. cavendish—rather unfair to herother stepson, mr. lawrence cavendish?”

Jennifer lawrence was fine.

there was abundant cover for zachary spurge and for half-a-dozen like himin the village school-house when the inquest was opened at ten o'clockthat morning. it seemed to copplestone that it would have been a physicalimpossibility to crowd more people within the walls than had assembledwhen the coroner, a local solicitor, who was obviously testy, irritable,self-important and afflicted with deafness, took his seat and lookedsourly on the crowd of faces. copplestone had already seen him inconversation with the village doctor, the village police, chatfield, andmarston greyle's solicitor, and he began to see the force of spurge'sshrewd remarks. what, of course, was most desired was secrecy andprivacy--the scarhaven powers had no wish that the attention of all theworld should be drawn to this quiet place. but outsiders were there inplenty. stafford and several members of bassett oliver's company hadmotored over from norcaster and had succeeded in getting good places:there were half-a-dozen reporters from norcaster and northborough, andplain-clothes police from both towns. and there, too, were all theprincipal folk of the neighbourhood, and mrs. greyle and her daughter,and, a little distance from audrey, alert and keenly interested, wasaddie chatfield.

Folks usually start rolling in around 6:45 generally speaking.

"your uncle must have posted it to me in london the day before he died,"he said mendaciously. "it was forwarded here, and at first i could makeneither head nor tail of it."

Disclaimer: this actually did happen today.

The word day has a number of meanings, depending on the context it is used such as of astronomy, physics, and various calendar systems.   

pratt came out of his stupor much sooner than esther mawson had reckonedon. according to her previous experiments with the particular drug whichshe had administered to him, he ought to have remained in a profound andan undisturbed slumber until at least five o'clock. but he woke atfour--woke suddenly, sharply, only conscious at first of a terrible painin his head, which kept him groaning and moaning in his chair for aminute or two before he fairly realized where he was and what hadhappened. as the pain became milder and gave way to a dull throbbing anda general sense of discomfort, he looked round out of aching eyes andsaw the bottle of sherry. and so dull were his wits that his onlythought at first was that the wine had been far stronger than he hadknown, and that he had drunk far too much of it, and that it had senthim to sleep--and just then his wandering glance fell on some paperswhich esther mawson had taken from one of his pockets and thrown asideas of no value.

Absolutely no damage to his car, and my car looked to be fine also.

 “i fancy not. the thieves ransacked the library and got very little for their pains. the whole place was turned upside down, drawers burst open, and presses ransacked, with the result that an odd volume of pope’s ‘homer,’ two plated candlesticks, an ivory letter-weight, a small oak barometer, and a ball of twine are all that have vanished.”

He just had a shoulder and a little bit after it and that was it.

 “it is customary at mawson’s for the clerks to leave at midday on saturday. sergeant tuson, of the city police, was somewhat surprised, therefore to see a gentleman with a carpet bag come down the steps at twenty minutes past one. his suspicions being aroused, the sergeant followed the man, and with the aid of constable pollock succeeded, after a most desperate resistance, in arresting him. it was at once clear that a daring and gigantic robbery had been committed. nearly a hundred thousand pounds’ worth of american railway bonds, with a large amount of scrip in other mines and companies, was discovered in the bag. on examining the premises the body of the unfortunate watchman was found doubled up and thrust into the largest of the safes, where it would not have been discovered until monday morning had it not been for the prompt action of sergeant tuson. the man’s skull had been shattered by a blow from a poker delivered from behind. there could be no doubt that beddington had obtained entrance by pretending that he had left something behind him, and having murdered the watchman, rapidly rifled the large safe, and then made off with his booty. his brother, who usually works with him, has not appeared in this job as far as can at present be ascertained, although the police are making energetic inquiries as to his whereabouts.”

I didn't have any money to pay the guy, so i thought i would cry my ass out to the watchman to give the driver some money till my parents came back.

sir ernest heavywether, who was famous all over england for theunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked twoquestions.

Also, sorry for englando, not my first language.

England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Wales to its west and Scotland to its north. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain, which lies in the North Atlantic, and includes over 100 smaller islands, such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight.

the woman went away--through the disused part of the old house into themodern portion. she went straight to a certain store closet and tookfrom it a bottle of old dry sherry which had been brought there from abin in the cellars--it was part of a quantity of fine wine laid down byjohn mallathorpe, years before, and its original owner would have beendisgusted to think that it should ever be used for the mere purpose ofquenching thirst. but esther mawson had another purpose in view, withrespect to that bottle. carrying it to her own sitting-room, shecarefully cut off the thick mass of sealing-wax at its neck, drew thecork, and poured a little of the wine away. and that done, she unlockeda small box which stood on a corner of her dressing table, and took fromit a glass phial, half full of a colourless liquid. with steady handsand sure fingers, she dropped some of that liquid into the wine,carefully counting the drops. then she restored the phial to itshiding-place and re-locked the box--after which, taking up a spoon whichlay on her table, she poured out a little of the sherry and smelled andtasted it. no smell--other than that which ought to be there; notaste--other than was proper. pratt would suspect nothing even if hedrunk the whole bottle.

The balance restored, i returned to my shallow self and pulled a quick 'nope' turn.

Restored is Jeremy Camp's fourth album, released on November 16, 2004.

"then i'll tell you," said levendale. "a chinese fellow--one chang li.he's got them--both! and stephen purvis and i have been after him forall the days and nights since we disappeared--and we're beaten! nowyou'll have to take it up--and i'd better tell you the plain truthabout what's no doubt seemed a queer business from the first.half-an-hour's talk now will save hours of explanation later on. solisten to me, all of you--i already see two gentlemen here, mr.killick, and mr. guyler, who in a certain fashion, can corroborate someparticulars that i shall give you. keep us free from interruption, ifyou please, while i tell you my story."

As anyone who is anyone knows, thanksgiving eve is one of the biggest party nights of the year.

Night is the period in which the sun is below the horizon.

“if you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone bymistake, you wouldn’t joke about it. come on, let’s have tea. we’ve gotall sorts of secret stores in that cupboard. no, lawrence—that’s thepoison cupboard. the big cupboard—that’s right.”

he was still pondering over these things when he went back to thegrange, later in the evening--but he was resolved not to say anythingabout them to nesta. and he saw nesta only for a few minutes. hermother, she said, was very ill indeed--the doctor was with her then, andshe must go back to them. since her son's death, mrs. mallathorpe hadscarcely spoken, and the doctor, knowing that her heart was not strong,was somewhat afraid of a collapse.

He came back a moment later to chat, but i'm pretty sure i saw his face crack.

gimblet had never seen her before; but, as he watched her slowdeliberate movements and quick intelligent eyes, he had an odd feelingthat they were already acquainted. she reminded him of some one; how, hecouldn't say. perhaps it was the features, perhaps merely theexpression, but if they had never previously met, at least he must haveseen some one she resembled. rack his brains as he might, he could notremember who it was. he put the thought aside. sooner or later therecollection would come to him.

Years later, i'm talking to a friend about old high school friends and such.

 and yet for all his watchfulness he was never depressed. on the contrary, i can never recollect having seen him in such exuberant spirits. again and again he recurred to the fact that if he could be assured that society was freed from professor moriarty he would cheerfully bring his own career to a conclusion.

No recollection of the humor, but something along the lines of a guy eating out his wife and ending up with blood all over his face.

The Recollects (French: Récollets) were a French reform branch of the Friars Minor, a Franciscan order. Denoted by their gray habits and pointed hoods, the Recollects took vows of poverty and devoted their  lives to prayer, penance, and spiritual reflection. Today, they are best known for their presence as missionaries in various parts of the world, most notably in early Canada.

"nothing unreasonable, mister," answered melky. "you'll easily satisfyme. game? come, now, mister--i know your game! bank first--to get someready--then somewhere to pick up a bit of luggage--then, a railwaystation. that's it, ain't it, now? no blooming good, mister--they'reready for you the minute you walk into that bank! if they don't takeyou then, they'll only wait to follow you to the station. mister!--youain't a cat's chance!--you're done--if you don't make it worth my whileto help you! see?"

And not knowing that i was hallucinating, i start to get really into it.

Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts (descriptive knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). By most accounts, knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many sources, including but not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry, education, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology.

the funeral of mrs. inglethorp took place the following day, and onmonday, as i came down to a late breakfast, john drew me aside, andinformed me that mr. inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take uphis quarters at the stylites arms until he should have completed hisplans.

Couple hours later i just completed the meal and placed the cheese back in the fridge unsuspecting, that night my life changed.

 “well, well, you did your best,” said holmes, as we walked into our room. “it’s very annoying, though, watson. i was badly in need of a case, and this looks, from the man’s impatience, as if it were of importance. halloa! that’s not your pipe on the table. he must have left his behind him. a nice old briar with a good long stem of what the tobacconists call amber. i wonder how many real amber mouthpieces there are in london. some people think that a fly in it is a sign. well, he must have been disturbed in his mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently values highly.”

I open the new box, make some biscuits and we are blown away at how much they taste like the real deal.

john purdie had a double object in calling on mr. spencer levendale. hehad mentioned to melky that when he met levendale in the highlands,levendale, who was a widower, had his children and their governess withhim. but he had not mentioned that he, purdie, had fallen in love withthe governess, and that one of his objects in coming to london justthen was to renew his acquaintance with her. it was chiefly of thegoverness that he was thinking as he stood on the steps of the bighouse in sussex square--perhaps, in a few minutes, he would see heragain.

Who knows how many people saw me that time but it's for sure at least a double digit.

 “‘for half an hour or so i discussed that old gentleman’s symptoms with him, and then, having prescribed for him, i saw him go off upon the arm of his son.

I was giddy, i felt like i was glowing inside, the adrenaline begin to fill my body with warmth, thinking of my escape.

"sir john standridge," said collingwood, mentioning a famous legalluminary of the day, "is going out to hyderabad to take certainevidence, and hold a sort of inquiry, in a big case, and i'm going withhim as his secretary and assistant--i was in his chambers for two years,you know. we leave next week, and we shall not be back until the end ofapril."

My girlfriend was raped yesterday.

 “he met me with the dog-cart at the station, and i saw at a glance that the last two months had been very trying ones for him. he had grown thin and careworn, and had lost the loud, cheery manner for which he had been remarkable.

I've actually grown quite fond of it.

his mind, always active, was busier than usual as he watched theripples roll away in endless succession from the sides of the inverashiel --which looked so strangely less white on closerinspection--or followed the smooth soaring movements of the gulls thatswooped and circled around her, as she puffed and panted on her wayacross the black, taciturn waters.

I'm at a department meeting and, as usual, there are supervisors and directors there.

"all right, mr. murgatroyd," he said. "nothing to be alarmed about--i'mout of that line, now--no papers of that sort tonight. i've a bit ofbusiness i can put in your hands--profitable business. look here!--haveyou got a quarter of an hour to spare?"

Every month or so my buddies and i throw our old papers into a bonfire and just hang out.

Paper is a thin, flat material produced by the compression of fibres.

"well, it gives one rather a kink in the back after a time," markadmitted. "but i shan't feel easy in my mind till i've looked througheverything, and i'm getting a very useful idea of the estate accounts inthe meantime. it  is  rather a long business, but i'm getting on with it,slow but sure. there are such a fearful lot."

For years, i had been removing things from the inside of my lips that are kinda useful.

Utility is a measure of the happiness or satisfaction gained from a good or service in economics and game theory.

"there's a lot of stuff there," answered the man in charge, pointing toa pile of books and papers on the table, "but it seems to be chieflyexercises and that sort of thing. i'll look through it myself, later."

This is when i got fed up so i looked for a way to break up with her.

To look is to use sight to perceive an object.

“it’s this way,” he said, “so far, we’ve only seen the case from theoutside. that’s where the yard’s at a disadvantage in a case of thiskind, where the murder’s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. alot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that’s where mr.poirot’s had the start of us. we shouldn’t have been here as soon asthis even, if it hadn’t been for the fact that there was a smart doctoron the spot, who gave us the tip through the coroner. but you’ve beenon the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some littlehints. from the evidence at the inquest, mr. inglethorp murdered hiswife as sure as i stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contraryi’d laugh in his face. i must say i was surprised the jury didn’t bringit in wilful murder against him right off. i think they would have, ifit hadn’t been for the coroner—he seemed to be holding them back.”

Now he talks to me about his drives to want to murder people.

Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought. This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter.  Manslaughter is killing committed in the absence of malice, brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness.

 “‘very likely not. it has been kept very quiet, for the capital was all privately subscribed, and it’s too good a thing to let the public into. my brother, harry pinner, is promoter, and joins the board after allotment as managing director. he knew i was in the swim down here, and asked me to pick up a good man cheap. a young, pushing man with plenty of snap about him. parker spoke of you, and that brought me here to-night. we can only offer you a beggarly five hundred to start with.’

It started out like this.

 “it  does  give a clue. whoever wrote that note was the man who brought william kirwan out of his bed at that hour. but where is the rest of that sheet of paper?”

I was there for 20 minutes until she convinced me that her mom doesn't really care and thought that was funny.

back against the wall, juliet cowered, her whole body shaken by greatsobs. she was petrified with terror of this fiendish man, but her fearsfor herself gave way before the horror of what she had seen.

I get a text from my friend saying she was headed home and could give me a ride since i lived along the way.

Way is a road, route, path or pathway, including long-distance paths.

“oh, come!” said summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.“surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. the man’s caughtred-handed. how he could be such a fool beats me!”

Saʽid (Arabic: سعيد‎ Saʽīd), also spelled Saʽeid, Said, Saïd, Sid, Saeed or Sayid, is a male Arabic given name which means "blessed (in Quranic Classical Arabic), good luck, joy" or "happy, patient". The name stems from the Arabic verb sa‘ada (سَعَدَ - 'to be happy, fortunate or lucky').

“to take the fragment of green material first, i found it caught in thebolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining oneoccupied by mademoiselle cynthia. i handed the fragment over to thepolice who did not consider it of much importance. nor did theyrecognize it for what it was—a piece torn from a green land armlet.”

The next train lands at the end of the line, i get off and in a mad sprint i rush through the gates and down towards the adjoining bus stop.

he stopped at a deserted stretch of the quay, and leaning against thewall which separated it from the sand, signed to gilling to stop also.

 “we were shut up in bhurtee, the regiment of us with half a battery of artillery, a company of sikhs, and a lot of civilians and women-folk. there were ten thousand rebels round us, and they were as keen as a set of terriers round a rat-cage. about the second week of it our water gave out, and it was a question whether we could communicate with general neill’s column, which was moving up country. it was our only chance, for we could not hope to fight our way out with all the women and children, so i volunteered to go out and to warn general neill of our danger. my offer was accepted, and i talked it over with sergeant barclay, who was supposed to know the ground better than any other man, and who drew up a route by which i might get through the rebel lines. at ten o’clock the same night i started off upon my journey. there were a thousand lives to save, but it was of only one that i was thinking when i dropped over the wall that night.

Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts (descriptive knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). By most accounts, knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many sources, including but not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry, education, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology.

the gates were near at hand; in silence they breasted the steep inclineof the drive, which wound and zigzagged up between high banks coveredwith rhododendron and bracken, and grown over with trees. after a quarterof a mile these gave place to an abrupt, grass covered slope, whose tophad been smoothed and levelled by the hand of man, and from which on thefar side rose the castle of inverashiel, its stout and ancient frameworkdisguised and masked by the modern addition to the building which facedthe approach; a mass of gabled and turreted stonework in the worst styleof nineteenth century architecture which in scotland often took on ashape and semblance even more fantastically repulsive than it assumed inthe south. the great tower that formed the principal remaining portion ofthe old building could just be discerned over the top of the flaringfaçade, but the nature of the site was such that most of the ancientfortress was invisible from that part of the grounds. juliet stopped atthe turn of the road.

Then i proceeded to go to the exam's building and doing it (needless to say, it didn't go very well).

A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory. Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures.

 “there are some very singular points here,” said holmes, smiling. “is it not extraordinary that a burglar—and a burglar who had had some previous experience—should deliberately break into a house at a time when he could see from the lights that two of the family were still afoot?”

Fortunately she is really nice, and she said she wouldn't report it.

Saʽid (Arabic: سعيد‎ Saʽīd), also spelled Saʽeid, Said, Saïd, Sid, Saeed or Sayid, is a male Arabic given name which means "blessed (in Quranic Classical Arabic), good luck, joy" or "happy, patient". The name stems from the Arabic verb sa‘ada (سَعَدَ - 'to be happy, fortunate or lucky').

"i don't know owt about it's being useful, sir, nor what use is to bemade on it," said pickard, "but i can tell you a bit o' truth, and youcan do what you like wi' what i tell. but," he went on, lowering hisvoice and glancing at the door by which he had just entered, "there'sanother name 'at 'll have to be browt in--private, like. name, as it sohappens, o' one o' your clerks--t' head clerk, i'm given tounderstand--mr. pratt."

 “‘it was the year ’55 when the crimean war was at its height, and the old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the black sea. the government was compelled, therefore, to use smaller and less suitable vessels for sending out their prisoners. the  gloria scott  had been in the chinese tea trade, but she was an old-fashioned, heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers had cut her out. she was a five-hundred-ton boat, and besides her thirty-eight gaol-birds, she carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. nearly a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set sail from falmouth.

She said something along the lines off "you *know* you'll stain the brand new carpet, you **know** how clumsy you are!".

but in spite of all her forced cheerfulness the time passed terriblyslowly. she found an old letter in her pocket, and a pencil, with whichshe scrawled painstaking directions for her rescue. she would push itthrough the hole, she thought, if she heard any sound of voices above theclamour of the burn. after that there remained nothing more to do, andthe hours seemed to creep along more and more slowly, till each secondseemed like a minute and each minute an hour. she tried to divert herselfby repeating poetry, and doing imaginary sums; and it was about eleveno'clock, when she was in the middle of the dates of the kings of england,that she heard gimblet's voice hailing her in a shout from below.

I've contacted support for the website i used, but haven't heard back yet.

his first thought was to hurry to his lodgings and pay his landlady. heowed her six weeks' rent, at ten shillings a week--that would takethree pounds out of the money he had just received. but he would stillhave over fourteen shillings to be going on with--and surely thoseexpected letters would come within the next few postal deliveries. hehad asked the editor who had taken two short stories from him to lethim have a cheque for them, and in his inexperience had expected to seeit arrive by return of post. also he had put his pride in his pocket,and had written a long letter to his old schoolmate, john purdie, infar-away scotland, explaining his present circumstances, and askinghim, for old times' sake, to lend him some money until he had finishedand sold a novel, which, he was sure, would turn out to be a smallgold-mine. john purdie, he knew, was now a wealthy young man--successorto his father in a fine business; lauriston felt no doubt that he wouldrespond. and meantime, till the expected letters came, he hadmoney--and when you have lived for four days on two shillings, fourteenshillings seems a small fortune. certainly, within the last half-hour,life had taken on a roseate tinge--all due to a visit to the pawnshop.

 again and much louder came the rat-tat-tat. we all gazed expectantly at the closed door. glancing at holmes, i saw his face turn rigid, and he leaned forward in intense excitement. then suddenly came a low guggling, gargling sound, and a brisk drumming upon woodwork. holmes sprang frantically across the room and pushed at the door. it was fastened on the inner side. following his example, we threw ourselves upon it with all our weight. one hinge snapped, then the other, and down came the door with a crash. rushing over it, we found ourselves in the inner room. it was empty.

In a building, a room is any space enclosed within a number of walls to which entry is possible only by a door or other dividing structure that connects it either to a passageway, to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it.

for this was the man, who, in a few years, had unravelled more apparentlyinsoluble mysteries, and caused the arrest of more hitherto evasivescoundrels, than his predecessors had managed to secure in a decade. thename of gimblet was known and detested wherever a coiner carried on hisforbidden craft, or a blackmailer concocted his cowardly plans; burglarsand forgers cursed freely when he was mentioned, and there was hardly anillicit trade in the country which had not suffered at one time oranother from his inquisitive habit of interesting himself in otherpeople's affairs. scotland yard officials were never too proud to callupon him for help, and many a difficulty he had helped them out of,though he refused an offer of a regular post in the criminalinvestigation department, preferring to be at liberty to choose whatcases he would take up. above all things he loved the strange andinexplicable. gimblet had not always been a detective. indeed, he oftensmiled to himself when he thought of the extraordinary confidence whichthe public now elected to repose in him.

All of my clothes, as well as anything else on the floor that wasn't secured were floating around the bathroom.

 “thank you. i should like to think over the matter a little now. if the cottage is now permanently deserted we may have some difficulty. if, on the other hand, as i fancy is more likely, the inmates were warned of your coming, and left before you entered yesterday, then they may be back now, and we should clear it all up easily. let me advise you, then, to return to norbury, and to examine the windows of the cottage again. if you have reason to believe that it is inhabited, do not force your way in, but send a wire to my friend and me. we shall be with you within an hour of receiving it, and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of the business.”

Just to make matters worse he's a doctor so he didn't think he should be bothering emergency services with something he could treat himself.

In classical physics and general chemistry, matter is any substance that has mass and takes up space by having volume. All everyday objects that can be touched are ultimately composed of atoms, which are made up of interacting subatomic particles, and in everyday as well as scientific usage, "matter" generally includes atoms and anything made up of them, and any particles (or combination of particles) that act as if they have both rest mass and volume. However it does not include massless particles such as photons, or other energy phenomena or waves such as light.: 21  Matter exists in various states (also known as phases). These include classical everyday phases such as solid, liquid, and gas – for example water exists as ice, liquid water, and gaseous steam – but other states are possible, including plasma, Bose–Einstein condensates, fermionic condensates, and quark–gluon plasma.Usually atoms can be imagined as a nucleus of protons and neutrons, and a surrounding "cloud" of orbiting electrons which "take up space". However this is only somewhat correct, because subatomic particles and their properties are governed by their quantum nature, which means they do not act as everyday objects appear to act – they can act like waves as well as particles and they do not have well-defined sizes or positions. In the Standard Model of particle physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because the elementary constituents of atoms are quantum entities which do not have an inherent "size" or "volume" in any everyday sense of the word. Due to the exclusion principle and other fundamental interactions, some "point particles" known as fermions (quarks, leptons), and many composites and atoms, are effectively forced to keep a distance from other particles under everyday conditions; this creates the property of matter which appears to us as matter taking up space.

finally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence againstother people besides john cavendish. he would direct their attention tothe fact that the evidence against mr. lawrence cavendish was quite asstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.

Now i knew absolutely nothing about exercise, just that it can make you stronger.

"are you saying that from--experience?" he asked.

There was a quote from conor saying he didn't give a shit and would go on to dominate boxing just like he did the ufc.

A saying is any concisely written or spoken expression that is especially memorable because of its meaning or style. Sayings are categorized as follows:

before gimblet could reply, the silence was broken by the rumble ofwheels; and a farmer's cart came up behind them, driven by a thin manin a black coat, who had evidently attended the funeral earlier in theday. the road, at the point they had reached, was beginning to ascend;and the stout pony between the shafts slowed resolutely to a walk as heleant against the collar. the man lifted his hat as lady ruth wishedhim good day.

Black is a color which results from the absence or complete absorption of visible light. It is an achromatic color, without hue, like white and gray. It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness. Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil, the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment, and night versus day. Since the Middle Ages, black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.Black was one of the first colors used by artists in neolithic cave paintings. It was used in ancient Egypt and Greece as the color of the underworld. In the Roman Empire, it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death, evil, witches, and magic. In the 14th century, it was worn by royalty, clergy, judges and government officials in much of Europe. It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century.  According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, evil, and elegance.Black ink is the most common color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, as it provides the highest contrast with white paper and thus is the easiest color to read. Similarly, black text on a white screen is the most common format used on computer screens. As of September 2019, the darkest material is made by MIT engineers from vertically aligned carbon nanotubes.

zillah had listened to lauriston's answers to mr. parminter's searchingquestions with an anxiety which was obvious to those who sat near her.the signs of that anxiety were redoubled as she walked slowly to thebox, and the glance she threw at the coroner was almost appealing. butthe coroner was looking at his notes, and zillah was obliged to turn tomr. parminter, whose accents became more mellifluous than ever as headdressed her; mr. parminter, indeed, confronting zillah might havebeen taken for a kindly benevolent gentleman whose sole object was toadminister condolence and comfort. few people in court, however, failedto see the meaning of the questions which he began to put in thesuavest and softest of tones.

Within two minutes i start having an anxiety attack.

Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil and includes subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events. It is often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination.Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue, inability to catch one's breath, tightness in the abdominal region, and problems in concentration. Anxiety is closely related to fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat; anxiety involves the expectation of future threat including dread. People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past.Though anxiety is a normal human response, when excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods it may be diagnosed as an anxiety disorder. There are multiple forms of anxiety disorder (such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) with specific clinical definitions. Part of the definition of an anxiety disorder, which distinguishes it from every day anxiety, is that it is persistent, typically lasting 6 months or more, although the criterion for duration is intended as a general guide with allowance for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of shorter duration in children.

"this!" answered the detective, with something of triumph in his tone."i've been making some enquiries already this morning, early as it is.when parslett was picked up and carried to the hospital--this st.mary's hospital, close by here--he was found to have fifty pounds ingold in his pocket. now, according to parslett's widow, whom i've seenthis morning, parslett was considerably hard up yesterday. trade hasn'tbeen very good with him of late, and she naturally knows hiscircumstances. he went out of the house last night about nine o'clock,saying he was going to have a stroll round, and the widow says she'scertain he'd no fifty pounds on him when he left her--it would be awonder, she says, if he'd as much as fifty shillings! now then, mr.purdie, where did a man like that pick up fifty sovereigns between thetime he went out, and the time he was picked up, dying?"

So of course they carried me to the couch so i could relax.

some months later, when audrey greyle had come into possession ofscarhaven, and had married copplestone in the little church behind hermother's cottage, she and her husband, to satisfy a mutual andlong-cherished desire, visited a certain romantic and retired part of thecountry. and in the course of their wanderings they came across a verypretty village, and in it a charmingly situated retreat, which looked soattractive from the road along which they were walking that they haltedand peered at it through its trimly-kept boundary hedge. and there,seated in the easiest of chairs on the smoothest of lawns, roses abouthim, a cigar in his mouth, the newspaper in his hand, a glass at hiselbow, they saw peter chatfield. they looked at him for a long moment;then they looked at each other and smiled delightedly, as children mightsmile at a pleasure-giving picture, and they passed on in silence. butwhen that village lay behind them, copplestone gave his wife a slyglance, and permitted himself to make an epigram.

A few nights ago a female friend of mine (let's call her y) and i visited a friend we both knew from highschool.

"which proves," interrupted copplestone, "that he's a member, and that iought to have followed up my attempt to get in there."

Now the tour group weren't expecting this, but they followed regardless, down the incredibly steep hill, packed with brambles and nettles.

 “miss susan cushing, living at cross street, croydon, has been made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical joke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to the incident. at two o’clock yesterday afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman. a cardboard box was inside, which was filled with coarse salt. on emptying this, miss cushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed. the box had been sent by parcel post from belfast upon the morning before. there is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the more mysterious as miss cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post. some years ago, however, when she resided at penge, she let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits. the police are of opinion that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon miss cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms. some probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these students came from the north of ireland, and, to the best of miss cushing’s belief, from belfast. in the meantime, the matter is being actively investigated, mr. lestrade, one of the very smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.”

My blood pressure if off the charts and my bilirubin level is over 4 [meaning my liver is having issues and explains why i am jaundiced/yellow].

Meaning most commonly refers to:

 a few words may suffice to tell the little that remains. an examination by experts leaves little doubt that a personal contest between the two men ended, as it could hardly fail to end in such a situation, in their reeling over, locked in each other’s arms. any attempt at recovering the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep down in that dreadful caldron of swirling water and seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their generation. the swiss youth was never found again, and there can be no doubt that he was one of the numerous agents whom moriarty kept in his employ. as to the gang, it will be within the memory of the public how completely the evidence which holmes had accumulated exposed their organization, and how heavily the hand of the dead man weighed upon them. of their terrible chief few details came out during the proceedings, and if i have now been compelled to make a clear statement of his career it is due to those injudicious champions who have endeavoured to clear his memory by attacks upon him whom i shall ever regard as the best and the wisest man whom i have ever known.    

I was stupid and young at the time, and did not comprehend how dangerous the part of town i was heading into was.

he walked forward until he came to the cab-rank at the foot of st.john's wood road, where he bundled melky into a taxi-cab, and bade thedriver get away to university college hospital at his best pace. therewas little delay in carrying out that order, but it was not such aneasy task on arrival at their destination to find any one who couldgive ayscough the information he wanted. at last, after they had waitedsome time in a reception room a young member of the house-staff came inand looked an enquiry.

Information is processed, organised and structured data. It provides context for data and enables decision making. For example, a single customer’s sale at a restaurant is data – this becomes information when the business is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish.More technically, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty; it answers the question of "What an entity is" and thus defines both its essence and the nature of its characteristics. The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts. Thus the concept becomes synonymous to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and entropy.

ayscough, like most men of his calling in london, had a considerableamount of general knowledge of things and affairs, and he summoned itto his aid in this instance. he knew that if the japanese really hadbecome possessed of the orange and yellow diamond (of whichsupposition, in spite of mirandolet's positive convictions, he was verysceptical) he would most certainly make for escape. he would be off tothe continent, hot foot. now, ayscough had a good acquaintance with thecontinental train services--some hours must elapse before yada couldpossibly get a train for dover, or folkstone, or newhaven, or theshortest way across, or to any other ports such as harwich orsouthampton, by a longer route. obviously, the first thing to do was tohave the stations at victoria, and charing cross, and holborn viaduct,and london bridge carefully watched for yada. and for two weary hoursin the middle of the night he was continuously at work on thetelephone, giving instructions and descriptions, and makingarrangements to spread a net out of which the supposed fugitive couldnot escape.

Great knick-knacks, and a really nice lady i interviewed.

“oh, it’s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. i drillwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. my wifeworks regularly ‘on the land’. she is up at five every morning to milk,and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. it’s a jolly good life takingit all round—if it weren’t for that fellow alfred inglethorp!” hechecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. “i wonder if we’vetime to pick up cynthia. no, she’ll have started from the hospital bynow.”

Come the morning, while i was getting ready for work, i noticed that my nose was awfully congested and i a slight soreness in the back of my throat.

Morning is the period from sunrise to noon. There are no exact times for when morning begins (also true of evening and night) because it can vary according to one's lifestyle and the hours of daylight at each time of year. However, morning strictly ends at noon, which is when afternoon starts. Morning can be defined as starting from midnight to noon.

"there's a many things i want to know," continued the blacksmith, with astout thump of the table. "they all tak' it for granted 'at young squirewalked on to yon bridge, an' 'at it theer and then fell to pieces. whosee'd it fall to pieces? who was theer to see what did happen?"

Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere). Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. Day length decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the Winter Solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). One of its main features in temperate climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.

 “having secured him, it is evident to me that a consultation of some sort was held. probably it was something in the nature of a judicial proceeding. it must have lasted for some time, for it was then that these cigars were smoked. the older man sat in that wicker chair; it was he who used the cigar-holder. the younger man sat over yonder; he knocked his ash off against the chest of drawers. the third fellow paced up and down. blessington, i think, sat upright in the bed, but of that i cannot be absolutely certain.

After what felt like an eternity, he came back out with a cheap bottle of wine, some cigars and a random woman at his side.

A cigar is a rolled bundle of dried and fermented tobacco leaves made to be smoked. Cigars are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes. Since the 20th century, almost all cigars are made of three distinct components: the filler, the binder leaf which holds the filler together, and a wrapper leaf, which is often the highest quality leaf used. Often there will be a cigar band printed with the cigar manufacturer's logo. Modern cigars often come with two bands, especially Cuban cigar bands, showing Limited Edition (Edición Limitada) bands displaying the year of production.

again he looked at the newcomer with a smiling interest, thinkingsecretly that he was a very youthful and ingenuous being to have writtena play which bassett oliver, a shrewd critic, and by no means easy toplease, had been eager to accept, and was about to produce. mr. richardcopplestone, seen in the flesh, looked very young indeed, and veryunlike anything in the shape of a professional author. in fact he verymuch reminded stafford of the fine and healthy young man whom one seeson the playing fields, and certainly does not associate with pen andink. that he was not much used to the world on whose edge he just thenstood stafford gathered from a boyish trick of blushing through the tanof his cheeks.

Later on, i got a little bit courageous and decided to do a cool trick.

lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. he had qualified as adoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived athome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had anymarked success.

Today, i was far more tired than usual for some reason, so i decided to hit the hay early.

 “this was the strange proposal, mr. holmes, with which the man blessington approached me. i won’t weary you with the account of how we bargained and negotiated. it ended in my moving into the house next lady day, and starting in practice on very much the same conditions as he had suggested. he came himself to live with me in the character of a resident patient. his heart was weak, it appears, and he needed constant medical supervision. he turned the two best rooms of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself. he was a man of singular habits, shunning company and very seldom going out. his life was irregular, but in one respect he was regularity itself. every evening, at the same hour, he walked into the consulting-room, examined the books, put down five and three-pence for every guinea that i had earned, and carried the rest off to the strong-box in his own room.

The rules at the range for shotguns is that you can only use slug rounds (a singular, heavy projectile) not birdshot (basically, a bunch of bb’s).

for this was the man, who, in a few years, had unravelled more apparentlyinsoluble mysteries, and caused the arrest of more hitherto evasivescoundrels, than his predecessors had managed to secure in a decade. thename of gimblet was known and detested wherever a coiner carried on hisforbidden craft, or a blackmailer concocted his cowardly plans; burglarsand forgers cursed freely when he was mentioned, and there was hardly anillicit trade in the country which had not suffered at one time oranother from his inquisitive habit of interesting himself in otherpeople's affairs. scotland yard officials were never too proud to callupon him for help, and many a difficulty he had helped them out of,though he refused an offer of a regular post in the criminalinvestigation department, preferring to be at liberty to choose whatcases he would take up. above all things he loved the strange andinexplicable. gimblet had not always been a detective. indeed, he oftensmiled to himself when he thought of the extraordinary confidence whichthe public now elected to repose in him.

Cradled by the cool stone and i release,letting nature freely run forwards over the stone.

spurge suddenly laid a grip on his companion's elbow and twisted himaside into a narrow entry between the sheds.

We said out goodbyes and i watched them travel up the road to return the jumper cables they borrowed while i twisted on the throttle.

"when i said we i should have said swallow," continued gilling. "youremember that afternoon of our return from bristol, copplestone? it seemsages away now, though as a matter of time it's only four days ago!--well,that afternoon swallow, who had had two or three more keeping a sharplook out for the squire, got a telephone message from one of 'em sayingthat he'd tracked his man to the fragonard club. i'd gone home to mychambers, to rest a bit after our adventures at bristol and falmouth, soswallow had to act on his own initiative. he set off for the fragonardclub, and outside it met his man. this particular man had been keeping awatch for days on that tobacconist's shop in wardour street. thatafternoon he suddenly saw the squire leave it, by a side door. hefollowed him to the fragonard club, watched him enter; then he himselfturned into a neighbouring bar and telephoned to swallow. the squire wasstill in the fragonard when swallow got there: from that time he kept awatch. the squire remained in the club for an hour--"

The only thing i know about root canals, is what i saw on finding nemo.

A saw is a tool consisting of a tough blade, wire, or chain with a hard toothed edge. It is used to cut through material, very often wood though sometimes metal or stone. The cut is made by placing the toothed edge against the material and moving it forcefully forth and less forcefully back or continuously forward. This force may be applied by hand, or powered by steam, water, electricity or other power source. An abrasive saw has a powered circular blade designed to cut through metal or ceramic.

“the temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.yet mrs. inglethorp ordered a fire! why? because she wished to destroysomething, and could think of no other way. you will remember that, inconsequence of the war economics practiced at styles, no waste paperwas thrown away. there was therefore no means of destroying a thickdocument such as a will. the moment i heard of a fire being lighted inmrs. inglethorp’s room, i leaped to the conclusion that it was todestroy some important document—possibly a will. so the discovery ofthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. i did not, ofcourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been madethis afternoon, and i will admit that, when i learnt that fact, i fellinto a grievous error. i came to the conclusion that mrs. inglethorp’sdetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of thequarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel tookplace after, and not before the making of the will.

Admittedly, i cried, but i deserved that pain so hard for being such an ungrateful ass.

"a member of the society, who occupies a high and responsible position onthe council, accompanied me to the neighbourhood, and from time to time ireport to him and receive his advice and instructions. he stays incrianan, so that i have some one within reach to go to for advice. atleast, so i am officially informed, but i know very well he is reallythere to keep watch on me, for it is not the habit of the society totrust its members more than is unavoidable. if it is possible, i go oncea week to crianan and make my report, but i can't always manage to go,and then he rows across the loch after dark and i go out and meet him. hewas to come on the night of the murder, and my first thought when i heardof it was that he might be caught in the shrubberies and mistaken for themurderer. but it appears that he had already taken alarm, and i amthankful to say he was able to escape in good time."

I was at my friend's house like almost every day after school (it became a habit) but that day he wanted to invite another one of his friends.

A habit (or wont as a humorous and formal term) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.The American Journal of Psychology (1903) defined a "habit, from the standpoint of psychology, [as] a more or less fixed  way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience." Habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when undertaking routine tasks. Habits are sometimes compulsory. A 2002 daily experience study by habit researcher Wendy Wood and her colleagues found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns which humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency; lack of awareness; unintentionality; and uncontrollability.

 “one would think that we were the criminals. let us have him arrested on his arrival.”

On arrival into the bathroom i think, "hey, why don't i treat the wife and do some manscaping down below" - i'm a true romantic.

In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes. In a slightly different sense, the term thought refers not to the mental processes themselves but to  mental states or systems of ideas brought about by these processes.

it was not till after her rescue, not till after she was given safelyover to the affectionate ministrations of lady ruth, that juliet gaveway under the strain to which she had been subjected, and broke downaltogether.

The lady insisted on me keeping my shoes on, but i politely took them off and left them at the door.

copplestone looked out of the window on his side of the car. already theywere clear of the norcaster streets and on the road which led toscarhaven. that road ran all along the coast, often at the very edge ofthe high, precipitous cliffs, with no more between it and the rocks farbeneath than a low wall. it was a road of dangerous curves and cornerswhich needed careful negotiation even in broad daylight, and this was ablack, moonless and starless night. but copplestone had impressed uponhis driver that he must get to scarhaven as quickly as possible, and heand his companion were both so full of their purpose that they paid noheed to the perpetual danger which they ran as the car tore roundpropections and down deep cuts at a speed which at other times they wouldhave considered suicidal. and at just under the hour they ran on thelevel stretch by the "admiral's arms" and looking down at the harbour sawthe lighted port-holes of some ship which lay against the south quay, andon the quay itself men moving about in the glare of lamps.

I decided, 'hey, you know what would be cool? if i made all my friends unique mix-cds based on our friendships.

A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying goods or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing. Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and purpose. In the Age of Sail a "ship" was a sailing vessel defined by its sail plan of at least three square rigged masts and a full bowsprit.

"i took a careful aim and fired. i saw him fall forward, and then ijumped off the plank and hurled it back under the hedge before i ran forthe house. i had left the door ajar, and i just stayed to close it, andthen darted into the empty billiard-room and thrust my rifle under asofa. it was a quick bit of work. i had counted on juliet byrne waiting amoment or two to see if she could do anything to help him before sheroused the house, or it roused itself, and she was rather longer than iexpected. i don't mind owning i got into a panic when minutes passed andno one appeared, and i began to think i must have missed the old boyaltogether. i was within an ace of going to make certain, when the dooropened and in she came. oh well, you know all the rest. that silly oldass, david, was still mooning about in the garden, thinking of her, isuppose, which was very lucky for me."

The policeman told me that we're ridiculously lucky to make it, considering the area of the motorway we were on.

five minutes later, when gimblet emerged once more into the open, hecarried in one hand a garden rake. with this he proceeded to thread hisway through the shrubbery, keeping close to the line of the holly hedge.when he thought he had gone about fifty yards, he lay down and peeredunder the leaves. the hedge was rather thinner at the bottom; and, bycarefully pushing aside a little of the glossy, prickly foliage, he wasable to make out that the end of the rose-bed he had lately examined wasseparated from him now only by the dividing barrier of the hedge. withthe rake still in his hand, he drew himself slowly forward, gingerlyintroducing his head and arms under the holly, till he was preventedfrom going farther by the close growing trunks of the trees that formedthe hedge.

My mom has been keeping me up to date with his condition through facebook messenger, which i have only very recently added to my phone.

Keeping is a surname. Notable people with the surname include:

"we didn't exactly know it was, sir, but afterwards, when it came out hislordship had told miss byrne he had made one, we thought it must havebeen that."

So, at the time, i had just start dating a girl that i've known for a very long time.

Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts (descriptive knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). By most accounts, knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many sources, including but not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry, education, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology.
